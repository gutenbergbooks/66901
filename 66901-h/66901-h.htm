to another work by Dr. Ferrero which will shortly
come into publication under the title of <i>Between the
Old World and the New</i>. It is in order to explain that
<i>Between the Old World and the New</i> was brought into
print in continental editions (in Italy, in France and
elsewhere) before the publication of the present work.
The author has, however, decided, that for the English-speaking
readers of the two volumes it would be advisable
to change the order of publication and to issue
first this study of Morals and Manners. The second
book, <i>Between the Old World and the New</i>, will appear,
in New York and in London, early in the autumn of
1914.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> object of the essays collected in this volume,
with the exception of three which recount three
curious episodes in Roman history, is the investigation
of the most important differences between the ancient
world and the modern, between Europe and America;
in what way and in what particulars the civilisations of
the ancients and of Europe have been modified respectively
by the course of centuries and by the passage of
the Atlantic. The essays were printed in the first
instance in a monthly publication—<i>Hearst’s Magazine</i>—for
the perusal of the multitude of hasty readers who
are content to skip from argument to argument, and
they are now republished in book form for the benefit
of those readers who may care to dwell on each argument
with greater deliberation. This volume may
be considered as the bridge which connects the <i>Greatness
and Decline of Rome</i> with a third work which, under
the title of <i>Between the Old World and the New</i>, will be
published shortly in New York and London.</p>

<p>A comparison between the ancient world and the
modern, between Europe and America, suggested to a
writer of ancient history by two long tours in the New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
World—such is the subject of this volume; and such is
the subject of the further book which at an early date
will again take up a number of the matters outlined in
these papers and will submit these to more exhaustive
consideration. But neither in this volume nor in its
successor must the reader expect the comparison to
resolve itself into a definite judgment; and if he imagines
that he has discovered such a verdict, he may rest
assured that he is mistaken. This book, and the other
which will follow it, have been written with the express
purpose of emphasising how vain it is to spend our time,
as we do, passing judgment on the progress or decadence
of the times, of nations, and of civilisations; of showing
how easy it is to reverse all the reasonings by which,
impelled by passions, interests, prejudices, or illusions,
we strive now to exalt, now to abase ourselves by comparison
with the ancients and by contrasting the inhabitants
of one continent with those of another;
of indicating what an easy and sure target irony and
dialectic have in all the doctrines, opinions, and beliefs
with which man endeavours to establish his by-no-means
sure judgments—all the doctrines, including
that of progress, at least in the sense in which progress
is generally understood.</p>

<p>Including that of progress? the American reader will
exclaim, with some misgiving. But are we not living
in the age of progress? Can that idea of progress
which every morning rises with the sun and sheds new
splendour on the two worlds on either side of the Atlantic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
and with the sun arouses them to their accustomed
tasks—can it be that this idea is but an illusion? No.
The author of these two books has not so much confidence
in his own wisdom as to try to discover whether
man is really progressing or not; whether he is moving
down the valley of the centuries towards a fixed goal,
or towards an illusion which retreats with each step he
takes in its direction. There is one point only which
the author proposes to make clear. There are at the
present day, on the one hand, those who despise the
present and worship the past, extol Europe and depreciate
America; on the other hand, those who declare
that they would not give one hour of the marvellous
present in which they live for all the centuries of the
past, and who rate America far more highly than they
do Europe. The author sets out to show that the
reason why the eternal disputes between the partisans
of these divergent views are so inconclusive, is that in
this discussion, as in so many others, each side postulates
two different definitions of progress, and in their
discussions of the past and of the present, of Europe
and of America, they start from this dual definition
as if it were single and agreed. The result is that
they cannot understand and never will understand, if
they discuss for a thousand years, each other’s point
of view.</p>

<p>The worshippers of the present and the admirers of
America argue, more or less consciously, from a definition
of progress which would identify it with the increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
of the power and speed of machines, of riches, and of
our control over nature, however much that control
may involve the frenzied squandering of the resources
of the earth, which, while immense, are not inexhaustible.
And their arguments are sound in their application
to the present age, and also to America, if we grant
that their definition of progress is the true one. For
though steam- and electricity-driven machinery claims
Europe as its birthplace, it has reached maturity and
has accomplished and is accomplishing its most extraordinary
feats in America, where, so to speak, it found
virgin soil to exploit. But the opposite school indignantly
denies that men are wasting their time and
contributing nothing to the improvement and progress
of the world, when they strive to embellish it or to
instruct it, to soothe and to restrain its unbridled
passions. In their view, the masterpieces of art, the
great religions, the discoveries of science, the speculations
of philosophy, the reform of laws, customs, and
constitutions, are milestones along the road to progress.
According to these, our age, intent only on making
money, ought to be ashamed when it compares itself
with the past. Machines are the barbarians of modern
times, which have destroyed the fairest works of ancient
civilisations. History will show the discovery of
America to have been little less than a calamity.</p>

<p>So two persons who, starting from these two definitions
of progress, set to work to judge the past and the
present, Europe and America, will never succeed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
understanding each other, any more than two persons
who, wishing to measure a thing together, adopt two
different measures. And the discussion will be the
more vain and confused, the less clearly and precisely
the thought of each disputant apprehends the primary
definition of progress, which does duty as a measure
for each. Indeed, this unfortunate state of affairs is
commoner than is generally supposed at the present
day, with the need for hurry which pursues us in every
act and at every moment, and with the great whirl of
ideas and words which eddies around us. To decide,
then, whether our times are or are not greater than those
of the ancients, whether America is superior to Europe
or Europe to America, we must discover which of these
two definitions is the true one. But is it possible to
prove that one of these definitions of progress is true
and the other false? How many to-day would dare
to deny that man made the world progress when, by
the use of fire, he launched on the path of victory the
locomotive across the earth and the steamer across the
ocean? Or when he captured and led through threads
of copper the invisible force of electricity adrift in the
universe? Or when he embellished the world with
arts, and enlightened it with studies, and tempered the
innate ferocity of human nature with laws, religion, and
customs? It is clear that neither of these two definitions
will succeed in putting the other out of court,
until men are willing either to superhumanise themselves
completely, renouncing material goods in favour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
of spiritual joys, or, sacrificing the latter to the former,
to bestialise themselves. So long as men with few
exceptions continue to desire riches and the control
of nature, as well as beauty, wisdom, and justice,
both these definitions of progress will be <em>partially</em> true.
Each will present to us one aspect of progress. It will
be impossible, if we adopt only one of the two, to decide
whether we are progressive or decadent, whether
America is worth more or less than Europe. Every
epoch and people will seem at one time and another to
be progressive or decadent, to be superior or inferior,
according as the one or the other definition is the basis
of judgment.</p>

<p>“But,” the reader will say, “why not then combine
the two definitions in one? Why not say that progress
is the increase of all the good things which man desires:
of riches, of wisdom, of power, of beauty, of justice?”
But in order to make of these two definitions a single
complete and coherent definition, we should have to
be certain that it is possible by a single effort to increase
all the good things of life. Is it possible, and
to what extent is it possible? That is a second grave
question which this book and its successor endeavour
to answer.</p>

<p>Many and various matters relating to Europe and
America are discussed in this book. Still more various
and diverse are the discussions in <i>Between the Old World
and the New</i>, which presents a series of dialogues occupying
the leisure hours of a two weeks’ voyage, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
course of which persons of different degrees of culture
and diverse casts of thought discuss Hamlet and progress,
machinery and Homer, the Copernican system
and riches, science and Vedanta philosophy, Kant and
love, Europe and America, Christian Science and sexual
morality. These matters are discussed fitfully with
mad rushes zigzag over the universe; and the fits and
rushes have somewhat dismayed certain critics on this
side of the Atlantic. “What a jumble!” they cry.
“What an encyclopædia, what an enormity it is!
What can Homer and machinery, Hamlet and America,
Copernicus and emigration have in common?”</p>

<p>In short, the perusal of <i>Between the Old World and the
New</i> in the original Italian has produced upon more
than one critic the same effect as if he had come back
to his house to find all his belongings, his letters, his
furniture, his clothes, shifted and turned upside down.
“What demon has been at work here?” he cries in
dismay. Such critics are not altogether wrong from
their point of view. Nevertheless, this demon, which
is always urging man to turn his home upside down
in the hopes of arranging it better, no adjuration will
succeed in exorcising from our epoch. I hope that,
when presented in the form of a book, these dialogues
will produce a less alarming impression on America.
Accustomed as she is to seeing such demons raging in
her house, she should not permit herself to be prevented
from taking breath in the satisfaction of having done
well, by the ambition to do better. To be sure, between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the so-called Homeric question and steam-engines,
between the discovery of America and the tendencies
of philosophy, between the troubles which torment us
in private life and the French Revolution, between
transatlantic emigration and the architecture of New
York, there is a connection. It is a profound, an organic,
a vital connection; for, in the last four centuries, little
by little, almost imperceptibly at first, then with a
speed which increased gradually up to the French Revolution,
finally, at headlong speed from the Revolution
to the present day, the world has changed in every part,
in form, spirit, and order. And it has changed in form,
order, and spirit, because it has changed the order of its
demands upon man. In compensation for the liberty
granted him in everything else, it has demanded of him
a rapidity, a punctuality, an intensity, and a passivity
of obedience in his work, such as no other epoch has
ever dreamed of being able to exact from lazy human
nature.</p>

<p>From the French Revolution onwards, throughout
Europe and throughout America, the political parties,
the social classes, and institutions, and the philosophical
doctrines which supported the principle of authority,
little by little, but everywhere and unintermittently,
have given way before the onslaught of the parties, the
classes, and the doctrines which support the principle
of liberty. The former have been forced sooner or
later to allow the right of free criticism and discussion
to oust the ancient duty of tacit obedience in the state,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
in religion, in the school, and ultimately in the family.
Poets and philosophers have extolled the liberation of
man from ancient servitudes as the most glorious victory
man can vaunt. A victory, certainly; but over
whom? Over himself, as it seems; since the limits,
within which man was content to rest confined until
the French Revolution, he himself had erected and
invested with sacred terrors. It is clear that the slave,
the tyrant, and the liberator were one and the same
person. Moreover, one may well think that, in gaining
his liberty, man has not been born again to a new destiny
nor has he regenerated his own nature; rather has he
learned to employ his own energies in a different way.
Man had lived for centuries within strict limits, which
confined in a narrow compass his curiosity, ambition,
energy, and pride. But within those limits he had lived
with greater comfort and less anxiety than we are living,
without racking his brains to invent or to understand
something new every day, not spurred on every hour to
produce at greater speed and in greater abundance, not
exasperated by the multitude of his needs nor agitated
from morning to night by the pursuit of the means to
satisfy them. But after the discovery of America and
the first great astronomical discoveries which shed
glory on the beginning of the sixteenth century, there
arose in man the first sparks of ambition to seek new
ways in the world outside the ancient limits. The
philosophies of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
and still more the first discoveries of science, lent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
boldness to these ambitions. One day men realised
that Prometheus, that clumsy thief, had stolen from
the gods only a tiny spark of the fire. They planned
a second robbery, discovered coal and electricity, and
invented the steam-engine. And behold! the French
Revolution, which confounded and upset, from one
end of Europe to the other, boundaries, laws, institutions,
and traditions—ideal and material limits. Then
at last man realised that he could conquer and exploit
the whole earth with iron and fire. At the same time
as liberty, a new, untiring, formidable eagerness invaded
the two worlds. All the limits which, for so
many centuries, had confined in a narrow circle the
energy and aspirations of even the most highly venerated
of men fell one after the other to the ground.
They fell, because the human mind could not have
launched out into the unknown to essay so many new
marvels if those ancient limits which imprisoned it had
remained standing. The multitude would not have
bowed their necks to the hard discipline of their new
work, if in compensation they had not been liberated
from other, more ancient, disciplinary restrictions.</p>

<p>In short, the great era of iron and fire began, in
which the principle of liberty was destined to assault
the principle of authority in its last entrenchments,
and to drive it right away to the farthest frontiers of
political, moral, and intellectual anarchy. But for
this very reason the era of iron and fire has seen the
gradual confusion and reduction to wavering uncertainty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
of all the criteria which served to distinguish
the beautiful from the ugly, the true from the false,
good from evil. These criteria have become confused
because they are and can be nothing else but limits;
limits which are precise and sure so long as they are
restricted, but become feeble the more they are enlarged.
But how can a century, which has made itself
so powerful by dint of overturning the ancient limits
on every hand, be expected to respect these limits in
the spiritual world? As a result we find a civilisation
which has built railways, studded the Atlantic with
steamers, exploited America, and multiplied the world’s
riches a hundredfold in fifty years,—we find it obsessed
by grotesque doubts and eccentric uncertainties with
regard to the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>, in which generation
after generation, accustomed to respect amongst other
limits those imposed by literary traditions, had unhesitatingly
agreed to recognise two masterpieces composed
by a poet of genius. So we see the epoch which has
overturned and destroyed so many thrones and altars
and made Reason and Science march in triumph
through the smoking ruins of a score of revolutions,—we
see it obsessed on a sudden by a thousand scruples,
halt, ask itself what is truth, whether it exists, and if it
can be recognised. We see it rack its brains to decide
whether what we know is a real and objective something
or only a creation of our fancy. All these scruples and
doubts are, as it were, the brow of a slope down which
our epoch slides at headlong speed towards the abyss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
of nothingness. And in the century which has given
man liberty, the certainty of food, comfort in abundance,
and so many guarantees against the oppression
of individuals and authorities as were known to no
previous century; in the century which, by overthrowing
so many limits, has banished from our midst so
many reasons for hatred and war, do we not hear a
thousand voices on every side cursing man for a miserable
slave and accusing the times of being corrupt;
crying that conditions must be purified with fire and
sword, according to some, with war, according to others,
with revolution? Having once transgressed the limits,
man has become insatiable. The more he possesses, the
more he wants. He no longer acknowledges any restraint
in his desires.</p>

<p>The quantity which vanquishes quality, the liberty
which vanquishes authority, the desires which blaze
out anew each time they are satisfied—these are the
forces and the phenomena which shape and fashion
our civilisation. For this reason we can, it is true,
accumulate vast hordes of wealth and conquer the
earth with iron and fire. But we must resign ourselves
to living in a new Tower of Babel, in the midst of a
confusion of tongues. The æsthetic, intellectual, and
moral confusion of our times is the price nature exacts
for the treasures which she is obliged to resign into our
power. This book and its successor have been written
with the object of throwing light on the obscure but
vital bond which links together in a living unity the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
most diverse phenomena of contemporary life. They
have not been written, as some have thought, with the
view of comparing the ancient and the modern civilisations,
Europe and America, to the detriment of the one
or of the other; much less with the view of denouncing
the régime of liberty, on the ground that it corrupts the
world, and of demanding that it be suppressed. To
find fault with the tendency of a civilisation, one must
postulate the fact that history has gone wrong. And
what criterion, what standard is there which justifies
a man in declaring to successive generations that they
ought to have held different objects in view, and
adopted other means to attain them?</p>

<p>No: the author’s only object has been to sound the
depths of life, in the hope of tracing that unity from
which flow forth and into which flow back again so
many apparently diverse phenomena; that unity in
which alone thought can find some respite from its
weary search after the secret of its own being and of
that of things in general. Without a doubt each one
of us attains only provisional success in his search for
this unity; but is not every work of man only provisional,
and what are we but beings destined to live only for
an instant? Therefore, I have endeavoured in this
book to reveal, by way of an analytical and rational
exposition, set out in the simplest and plainest terms,
the vital bond of this unity. But, inasmuch as a unity
is a synthesis, and analysis necessarily modifies and
disfigures while trying to explain, I have availed myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
in my other work of what is perhaps the most effective
method of representing the phenomena of life in their
synthesis: I mean, art. For this reason I have written
a dialogue, in which I have made my characters begin
by wandering haphazard over a wide field and jumping,
apparently at random, from one to another of a series
of widely different topics. But at the end the various
topics are gathered into a united whole, showing the
bond which unites them, in the speeches of the most
acute and intelligent of the passengers; especially in
that speech which coincides with the entry of the ship
from the open Atlantic, the free high-road of the new
world, into the Mediterranean, the confined arena of
ancient civilisation. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Livre désordonné et pourtant bien
ordonné</i> is the verdict of a French critic, André Maurel.
How glad I should be if all my readers subscribed to
this verdict! In truth, this tragic conflict of the two
worlds, of the two civilisations, of man with himself,
for licence to dispense with the limits of which he, in
fact, has need if he is to enjoy the most exquisite fruits
of life, is a picture so vast as to overtax the resources
of the painter. But the painter has worked at his
canvas with so much ardour and passion that he hopes
to find on the other side of the Atlantic, as on this,
readers willing to view the defects in his work
with the intelligent indulgence of which really cultured
men are always so liberal; readers prompt to
feel some quickening in response to the few sparks
of beauty and of truth which the author may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
succeeded in infusing into his work. It is a small
thing, no doubt. But do not even the tiny rivulets
which flow through the valleys unite to form the
mighty rivers in the plain?</p>

<span class="subhead">ANCIENT SOCIAL SYSTEMS AND CONTEMPORARY AMERICA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">At</span> the end of the year 1906, while sojourning in
Paris, where I had been giving at the Collège de
France a course of lectures on Roman history, I received
an invitation from Emilio Mitré, the son of the
famous Argentine general, to undertake a long expedition
to South America. This invitation evoked general
surprise. What, my friends asked, was I, the historian
of the ancient world, going to do in the newest of new
worlds, in ultra-modern countries, in countries without
a past and caring only for the future, where industry
and agriculture fill the place which for the ancients was
occupied by war? Why, if I was willing to leave my
studies and my books for one moment, did I not repair
to Egypt or the East, the scene of so much of the history
which I had recounted, where the Romans have left so
many traces of the world which has passed away, and
where so many important excavations, tending to
enrich history with new documentary evidence, are in
progress?</p>

<p>I answered my questioners by pointing out that I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
not a bookworm, whose interest was confined to ancient
books and archæological parchments; that life in all
its aspects interested me, and that I was, therefore,
curious, after devoting so much attention to ancient
peoples, to study awhile the most modern of nations,
the newest comers in the history of our civilisation.
Did my friends suppose that, because I had written a
history of Rome, I had pledged myself never again to
direct my gaze to modern life? But, though I explained
the reason for my voyage in this way, I, no less than
my friendly objectors, was convinced at that time that
my travels in America would be only a parenthesis in my
intellectual life. In other words, I thought that I was
going to America in search of an intellectual diversion,
hoping for some relaxation for my mind, obsessed for
the last ten years by ancient history, in bringing it to
bear on an entirely different world. That this diversion
would be useful to me, I had no doubt; but not
because America might help me to a better understanding
of ancient Rome, but because to change every
now and again the subject-matter of my studies and to
enrich my mind with new impressions always seemed
to me one of the most profitable intellectual exercises,
especially for a historian to whom a wide experience of
human nature is a necessity. To-day, after having
made not one, but two journeys to America, after having
seen not only the two largest and most flourishing states
of South America, but also that North America which,
more than all the other states of the New World, represents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
in the eyes of contemporaries the more modern
part of our civilisation, the reign of machinery, the
empire of business, the rule of money, I am no longer
of this opinion. It is my present belief that a journey
in the New World is of supreme benefit intellectually to
a historian of the ancient world; and that, in order to
understand the life and history of Greek or Roman
society, it is perhaps just as important to visit the
countries of America as Asia Minor or Northern Africa.
That is what I said on one of the last days of my stay
in the United States to a genial professor of ancient
history connected with Cornell University, with whom
I was discussing the most famous schools of the present
day for the pursuit of historical studies, and the methods
adopted in these schools. “Many of you Americans,”
I said, “go to European universities to study ancient
history. It seems to me that you might well invite
many European professors to come and go through a finishing
course in America, studying not only in libraries
but in the live world, and observing what happens
in American society. Nobody is in a better position
than are you to understand ancient society.” My
remark may seem at first sight a paradox. But it is no
paradox, if one goes to the root of the problem. For
what we, men of the twentieth century, call ancient
civilisations, were really, when they flourished, new and
young civilisations, with but few centuries of history
behind them; and so are the American civilisations of
the present day. For this reason, we find in ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
civilisations, on however much reduced a scale, many
phenomena which are now peculiar to American social
systems; while we should look for them in vain in
European civilisation, which has more right to call itself
ancient civilisation than have the civilisations of Greece
and of Rome. This I propose briefly to prove.</p>

<p>One of the social phenomena which are most characteristic
of North America, but which would be looked
for in vain in Europe, is the munificence of the donations
of wealthy men to the public. Families of great wealth
in America nowadays feel it incumbent on them, as a
social duty, to spend a part of their substance on
the people; to encourage education and culture, to
bestow benefactions, to help the more needy classes,
and to assist with their purses the public authorities in
the execution of their functions. In Europe, the case
is different. Large fortunes may be numerous, but
they are kept more in the background than in America.
Rich men are much more selfish in the enjoyment of
their riches. Even the richest are, as a rule, content
to leave some small sum in their wills to the poor, or to
some educational institution. But donations in excess
of four thousand pounds are rare, and make a great
stir. It is for this reason that certain sections of society
in Europe accuse the upper classes of selfishness and
hold up before them American generosity as an example
to follow. But this censure is exaggerated, for the
times and the social conditions are different in Europe.
The history of the ancient world shows that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
generosity on the part of the rich is a phenomenon
peculiar to a certain stage in the development of society,
which recurs in all flourishing and prosperous, but as
yet not very ancient, societies. In these, some of the
public functions are assumed by the rich, because the
State has not yet had the time to bring them under its
control and to direct them according to laws by it
established. If the millionaires of America have, as a
matter of fact, but few imitators in Europe, they can
boast numberless forerunners in the histories of Greece
and Rome. In Athens to begin with, and, later, in
the Roman Empire, to mention only the most famous
states of the ancient world, education, charity, public
amusements, even public works, such as roads, theatres,
and temples, were always in part left by the State to
the generosity of wealthy individuals, who felt it their
duty to contribute out of their means to the public
welfare.</p>

<p>Amongst the inscriptions which have reached us
from the Roman world, and which have been collected
in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</i>, we find a
considerable number referring to these donations. In
all the provinces of the vast Empire, in all the cities
great and small, stories have been found recounting,
often in forcible terms, the donation by some citizen,
during his life or at his death, of a certain sum to the
city, it might be to construct or repair an edifice, it
might be to distribute grain to the people in time of
dearth, or to give bounties of oil on festive occasions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
or to assure to the people the enjoyment of certain
periodical spectacles, or to supplement the finances of the
city, which had been thrown into disorder by excessive
expenditure, or which were not equal to all the calls
made upon them. Every city, then, had her own
millionaire benefactors, her little Carnegies, her Huntingtons,
Morgans, and Rockefellers in miniature, whose
generosity was necessary to the public good, and to
whom were raised in gratitude monuments, many of
which have come down to our time.</p>

<p>The Roman Emperor himself was, at first at any
rate, only the most generous and the best known of
these rich donors: a kind of Carnegie, Morgan, and
Rockefeller of the Empire. Suetonius, for instance,
tells us what sums Augustus spent in the course of his
life, out of his private patrimony, on public objects.
Augustus himself, in the famous <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Monumentum Ancyranum</i>,
the great inscription found in Asia, in which he
gives a clear résumé of the story of his life, enumerates
many of the gifts which he made to the public out of his
own pocket. On several occasions, he simply liquidated
the deficit in the Empire’s budget out of his private
purse. At another time, he repaired at his own expense
the roads of Italy which after the civil wars had through
neglect fallen into disrepair. On countless occasions, he
spent money for public works, for the relief of famine, for
popular amusements, for all the forms of beneficence
then customary, without paying any regard to the
serious inroads he was making on the fortune which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
would have to leave to his own heirs. This is exactly
what many wealthy men are doing to-day in the New
World. It would be in accord with the facts to say
that those striking largesses were one of the means by
which imperial authority was gradually concentrated
at the heart of the Roman State, and surrounded itself
with so much gratitude, so many interests, and so many
hopes as to be able definitely to secure the principal
position amongst all the organs of the State.</p>

<p>But if the Emperor was the most generous of the
public benefactors, he was not the only one. The chief
men throughout the Empire followed his example, some
of them on so elaborate a scale as to challenge comparison
with the most munificent American millionaires,
when account is taken of the difference in the standards
of riches in the respective epochs. The best-known
figure among these donors is Herodes Atticus, an immensely
rich Athenian of the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
What was his origin, and whence he got his money, we
do not know. Probably he belonged to one of those
families which had accumulated immense property in
the provinces, during the first century of the Christian
era, a century of rapidly acquired and great fortunes.
This much is certain, that he applied himself to study,
and became what was then called a rhetor, corresponding
more or less closely to what we term a professor
of literature, not however with a view to earning a
livelihood, but with the object of cultivating his own
and other people’s minds. Highly cultured, erudite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
and at the same time one of the richest men in the
Empire, Herodes was a great friend of Antoninus Pius
and of Marcus Aurelius. But, great as was his reputation
for wisdom and literary taste, and notwithstanding
the enhancement of his prestige through the friendships
of the two celebrated emperors, he left a name in the
social history of the Roman world more particularly because
of the vast sums he gave away all over the Empire.
At Athens, he repaired in a splendid way the most ancient
and famous buildings of that celebrated city. He presented,
repaired, and maintained theatres, aqueducts,
temples, and stadia in the cities of Greece and Italy.</p>

<p>For the rest, several of the most highly admired
buildings and most imposing ruins in Rome are actually
gifts made to the public by ancient citizens. Out of
them all, I may cite the Pantheon, that marvellous
Pantheon, which we all still admire in the heart of
Rome, the monument which stands deathless while the
stream of ages flows by. This was constructed by
Agrippa, the friend of Augustus, at his own expense, and
can be compared in this respect to Carnegie Hall in New
York. Agrippa built the Pantheon from the same
notions of civic zeal that impelled Carnegie to endow
New York with his great Hall. And the two monuments,
built by the personal munificence of two ultra-wealthy
citizens, with an interval of twenty centuries
between them, express the same desire to extend to the
whole people a share in the enjoyment of the donor’s
private fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>Naturally, my earliest studies in Roman history led
me to fix my attention on this bountiful munificence on
the part of private persons in the ancient world, by
which the rich, either spontaneously or at the call of
public opinion, took upon themselves a share of the
public burdens. But I had not fully grasped the meaning
of this system, until I visited America, and saw the
colleges, schools, and hospitals founded and subsidised,
the museums and universities endowed, and all the
other public institutions aided with millions of dollars
by the rich business men and bankers of America.
For Europeans, living on a continent where nowadays
the State has almost monopolised these functions and
exercises them zealously, seeming to resent the interference
of private persons, it is difficult to picture
correctly a social system in which private generosity is
at once possible and necessary, the advantages by
which such generosity is accompanied, and the manner
in which it is exercised.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The munificence of the wealthy citizens is only a
special instance of a more general and more extensive
phenomenon in which America approaches more nearly
to the ancient world than Europe; I mean, in that her
society is less essentially bureaucratic. In the ancient
world, there was no bureaucratic organisation in any of
the Greco-Asiatic monarchies founded by Alexander or
in the latest period of the Roman Empire which could
be considered to resemble even remotely, on a smaller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
scale and merely in broad outlines, that which flourishes
in the Europe of to-day. Now, in the most splendid
moments of Greek and Roman history, we find states
in which all the public functions, even the executive
ones, were elective; so that they all changed periodically
according to the whims of an electoral body. The need
for technical training and professional education for
the exercise of certain executive functions was so little
recognised that even the command of the military
forces and the chief magistracy were filled by public
election. A general became a general, not in the course
of his professional career, but at the will of the people,
assembled in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">comitia</i>; and with generals chosen in
this way, Rome conquered the world. It is impossible
to imagine a social constitution in more striking contradiction
to the social constitution of contemporary
Europe, which entrusts all the executive functions to a
bureaucracy professionally trained, formed into a rigid
hierarchy, and dependent on the State, over which the
people have practically no power. Men in Europe
become generals or judges because they have studied
the art of war or law in special schools, not because the
majority of an electoral body have thought it opportune
to entrust the office to an individual who has been
clever enough to appeal to them more strongly than do
his rivals.</p>

<p>This difference was and is one of the greatest difficulties
met with by European historians in the study of
the ancient world. I am of opinion, for example, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
this is one of the weakest points in Mommsen’s history.
Accustomed to see bureaucratic states at work, European
historians find it difficult to imagine how those
states can have prospered in which the magistrates
changed periodically, sometimes every year, and in
which there was no professional division between the
different functions. Instinctively, they tend also to
paint the ancient state in the colours of the European
state, attributing to it the same virtues and the same
defects, and, therefore, representing its weaknesses as
well as its merits in a false light. For an American, on
the other hand, especially for a North American, the
difficulty of understanding the ancient states is
much less formidable. Certainly the principle of professional
specialisation is much more highly developed
in modern American society than it was in the ancient
societies. Modern civilisation is nowadays too
complex and too technical to admit of the principle
of popular election being applied indiscriminately, as
at Athens or Rome, to all the public offices. What
sensible man would consent to-day, even in the
purest of democracies, to the election of the admirals,
for instance, by universal suffrage? Nevertheless,
in the American confederation many of the public
offices, which are now entrusted in Europe to the
professional bureaucracy, are elective. And this fact
by itself is enough to represent a distinct <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rapprochement</i>
between American society and ancient
society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>For this reason, an inhabitant of New York can more
easily than an inhabitant of London or Paris picture to
himself certain aspects of the life of the Athens or Rome
of ancient days; especially the continual and frequent
succession of elections, and the complete change of
interests and of directing forces involved in the change
of the magistrates in office. It is true that we in Europe
have periodical elections, as in America. Periodically,
in the Old, as in the New World, the people assemble
to exercise their sovereign right by means of the ballot.
But if, regarded superficially, the act and the procedure
are identical, their value and importance are different.
The populace in the old states of Europe elect only
consultative and legislative bodies, while the executive
power remains to a great extent independent of the
people, residing in a professional bureaucracy whose
members cannot be changed from day to day.</p>

<p>In America, on the contrary, as in ancient Athens and
Rome, many of the magistrates who hold in their hands
and exercise directly governing powers are periodically
changed at the will of the people, which, therefore,
moulds more directly the government and its different
organs and more directly inspires and controls its
particular functions, just as it used to control them in
the ancient states.</p>

<p>It is not strange, therefore, that we find ancient Rome
reappearing in one of the most important juridical institutions
of the United States, an institution which we
should search for in vain in Europe, great mistress of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
laws though she be accounted. One of the American
institutions which seems to Europeans most contrary
to the modern spirit, and for that reason most deserving
of severe blame, is the right of “injunctions” with
which American magistrates are invested. To Europe,
where the bureaucracy, though immovable and little
subject to control, cannot step outside the precise
prescriptions of the law in the exercise of its functions,
this discretionary power of the American magistrates
seems little less than an instrument of intolerable
tyranny. A brilliant European, who is a distinguished
professor of literature in one of the universities of North
America, but who, notwithstanding a very lengthy
sojourn in the American republic, has preserved intact
the ideas and the spirit of the Old World, said to me one
day in New York: “In this land of liberty, there is one
tyranny more terrible than all the tyrannies of Europe,
that of the judicial power!” That a magistrate should
have the power to give orders, be they of only momentary
validity, which are the expressions of his own will
and not of the letter of the law, seems to the European
a monstrous thing, a relic of the ancient tyrannies,
which harmonises but ill with republican institutions.</p>

<p>A historian of the ancient world, on the other hand,
is in a position to understand more easily this seeming
contradiction. The injunction is nothing else than the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">edictum</i> of the Roman magistrate; the power, that is to
say, which the Roman magistrate possessed, and which
the American magistrate, maybe in a less degree,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
possesses, of making good with his personal authority
the lacunæ and deficiencies in the law, on every occasion
when public order or the principles of justice seemed
to demand it urgently. In the eyes of ancient Rome, the
magistrate was not only, as in the bureaucratic states
of Europe, the cautious and impartial servant and
executor of the law. He was also the living personification
of the State and of the general interest, invested
with full powers of exercising his own judgment, over
and above the laws, on behalf of the State and of the
general interest, when the law was found wanting. In
short, by reinforcing the authority of the magistrates,
the ancient states endeavoured to make amends for the
weakening of the State which was bound to ensue from
the continual electoral changes and the instability of
all the offices; while Europe, on the other hand, which,
with her rigid bureaucracies, has made the power of the
State so strong, can rigorously limit the powers of her
functionaries with laws of immense scope. But one
last remnant of the ancient conception, tempered by
the modern spirit of the State, survives in North America,
where, the elective principle being more extensively
applied than in the states of Europe, the tendency is,
by way of compensation, to reinforce by some discretionary
power, like the “injunction,” some at least of the
judicial offices. Perhaps we may explain in this way
the fact that some European writers in the nineteenth
century have ventured to assert that the ancients never
knew what liberty was, even in what were apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the most democratic republics; while others have
maintained that more liberty is to be found in the constitutional
monarchies of Europe than in the authoritative
American republics.</p>

<p>Another instance still more curious is afforded us by
those dictators who, under varying titles and with
varying success, have appeared in almost all the republics
of Spanish America, after the emancipation of these
territories from the mother country. The latest of these
dictators was Porfirio Diaz, who governed Mexico for
so many years. Europe has never properly understood
these dictators. She has mistaken them for caricatures,
now of Nero, now of Napoleon, and has drawn
the conclusion that the republics in question were
impregnated with the disease of tyranny, and could not
exist in a state of liberty. But a historian of the
ancient world recognises at once in these dictators a
modern incarnation of a figure which constantly appears
in ancient history, the Greek τύραννος, the Roman
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">princeps</i>. Pisistratus and Augustus, not Nero and
Napoleon, are the prototypes of these dictators. States
based on an electoral system which is not controlled by
organised parties or by other social forces calculated to
ensure its working in conformity with precise and certain
rules, are subject to eruptions of disorder, which
end in establishing the personal power of that individual
who succeeds in making the political and administrative
machine work with comparative regularity.
Augustus was throughout forty-one years re-elected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
every five or ten years head of the republic, because he
had succeeded, by his influence and personal ability, in
making the machine of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">comitia</i> and senate run
smoothly, at a time when the Roman aristocracy, which
had controlled it for centuries, could no longer, owing
to its own discords, do so. The reason why the power of
Augustus was prolonged and extended in all directions
until it became a dictatorship for life, cloaked under
legal forms, was that he alone seemed capable of ensuring
a wise government and of preventing civil wars.
And was not just this the real reason for the long tenure
of power by Porfirio Diaz in Mexico, and for his prolonged
presidency, which was merely a dictatorship
masquerading under republican forms? Anyone who
wishes to understand the government of Mexico during
the last forty years might find the history of Augustus
of great service; just as a profound knowledge of the
recent history of Mexico might help to the understanding
of the ancient history of Augustus.</p>

<p>A profound study of ancient history is, therefore, an
excellent preparation for the rapid understanding of
certain parts, at any rate, of the American constitution
and of American society; just as a knowledge of America
should be an excellent aid to the study of ancient
history. In fact, in the course of my travels and observations
in America, after having devoted ten years to
the study of a large section of ancient history, I have
realised how much the ancient history, which I had
studied in Europe, helped me to understand America;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
and how much the America which I had before my eyes
helped me to a better understanding of the distant
reality of that vanished world of long ago. And if we
follow the track of these studies and reflections, I think
that we shall be able to attribute also a more precise
meaning to that epithet of “young,” which is constantly
applied to America. Who does not talk a hundred
times a year of old Europe and young America? Now
what do these two much-used and much-abused epithets
mean? That Europe has a longer history than
America? In that case the contrasting terms would
not mean much. For that is a simple chronological
statement, which only demands a knowledge of the
fact that America was not discovered till 1492 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
Do they mean that America is more vigorous, more
active, more daring than Europe, just as young men
usually possess these qualities in a greater degree than
the old? As a matter of fact, many people do use the
two adjectives in this sense. But, in that case, they
assume as proved one of the most complex, one of the
deepest and most difficult problems of modern life,
that is to say, the problem whether a comparison can
be struck between Europe and America, and if so, on
the basis of what criterion? That there should be those
who strike this comparison and resolve it in this way,
is not surprising. But no one will be found to pretend
that the judgment contained in those two words
“young” and “old,” thus interpreted, can or ought to
be accepted as true by everyone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, it is possible to agree on a more
narrow and precise interpretation of these words; to
say that America is young and Europe old, because
America reproduces some of the characters and phenomena
which we find in antiquity, that is to say, in the
remotest epochs of our history. European civilisation,
as the result of her migration to America, there to found
new states and societies, has really become, in a certain
sense, regenerated, because she has again become, in the
light of certain characteristics and certain institutions,
what she was twenty centuries ago. And if the “youth”
of America is understood in this sense, it is not rash
to argue that it too will grow old. The study of
ancient history can be of a certain practical value to
those who consider America with the object of divining,
in this great community, the tendencies and inclinations
of the future. For students of that history can bring
a plausible criterion of prevision to their observations.
In fact, it is not rash to suppose, at least if some unknown
force does not unexpectedly divert the course of
events in the New World, that all the parts of American
life and society which most resemble ancient society are
destined to disappear gradually, as America grows older
and elaborates a complex and artificial civilisation;
just as the ancient institutions and ideas of which we
find so many traces in America gradually disappeared
in Europe in the progress of time, as civilisation in the
Old World became artificial and complex. If this
prophecy is not fallacious, we should expect history,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
which eternally repeats herself, to require the man of
the New World to witness the same phenomena whose
more gradual realisation they have already witnessed
in the ancient world. In the New World also, we
should expect to see a society regulated by elective and
authoritative institutions gradually become bureaucratic
and at the same time fetter every branch of
political and administrative powers with the tight
bonds of rigid juridical principles. This will be a slow,
but profound transformation, in the course of which
many things will change their position and value.
Perhaps the inexhaustible public munificence of the
millionaires will become exhausted, and the State will
grow in prestige and influence, if not in power.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Suetonius</span> recounts that one day a man presented
himself to the Emperor Vespasian, and showed
him the models of a machine, thanks to which the
Emperor could have finished off the construction of
certain of his great public works with fewer labourers,
and at a great saving of expense. Vespasian was full
of praise for the man’s ingenuity, and recompensed him
with a sum of money; but he subsequently had the
model destroyed, saying that he did not wish to have
any machines which would cause his people to go
hungry. Applying the standard of modern ideas, how
should we judge this sentiment and act? Of course, we
should consider it a strange and absurd mistake. Suetonius,
on the contrary, quotes the incident to prove
how wise Vespasian was. In this divergence of opinion
is revealed the essential difference between ourselves
and the ancients, between modern civilisation and
Greco-Roman civilisation, for all that these resemble
each other in so many particulars; the principal difference
between the ancient world and America. Although,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
as I have shown in my preceding essay, America in certain
of its institutions and forms of social life resembles
the ancient world more than Europe, this comparison
does not hold true so far as the instruments of economic
production are concerned. In this respect America is
much further removed from the ancient world than is
Europe, and represents to-day the beginning of a new
era and a new civilisation, whose spirit and tendencies
would be quite incomprehensible to a re-embodied
Greek or Roman.</p>

<p>Greco-Roman antiquity never dreamed that it might
be a useful, beautiful, glorious work to invent machines
of increasing speed and power, and therefore never gave
a thought to those technical elaborations which are the
pride of our times. It possessed the elementary machines,
the lever, jack-screw, the inclined plane; but
it never tried to combine these into more complicated
machines. In particular, it never called into play the
effort to which all the mechanism of modern times owes
its birth; that is to say, it never tried to endow its
machines with a more rapid motion than the muscles
of men or of animals can endow them with, or to search
nature for motive forces of greater power than these.
It availed itself only sparingly and on rare occasions
of the force of running water or of the wind. The
latter it used only for navigation, and even then with
regret, hesitation, and fear, as if it were doing an illicit
and shameful thing. It knew of no combustible other
than the wood of the trees. Notwithstanding the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
that Pliny the elder has preserved for us so much
precious information about agriculture and the ancient
arts and industries, his writings contain scarcely a
single hint suggesting that the men of his civilisation
had any desire to make the instruments of economic
production more perfect and effective. In one place,
the sail, as compared with the oar, inspires him to
write a passage in which the modern reader imagines
just at first that he has lighted on a sentiment containing
a distant echo of contemporary enthusiasm for
progress. “Is there a greater marvel in the whole
world?” he writes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A grass exists [flax, of which sails are made] which brings
Egypt and Italy so close together that two prefects of
Egypt, Galerius and Balbillus, crossed from Alexandria to
the straits of Messina, one in seven days and the other in
six; and that last summer the senator Valerius Marianus
reached Alexandria from Pozzuoli in a light wind in nine
days. There is a grass which brings me in seven days from
Gades, the harbour near the Pillars of Hercules, to Ostia,
in four from this side of Spain, in three from the province
of Narbonne, in two from Africa, as C. Flavius, the envoy
of the proconsul Vilius Crispus, found.</p>
</div>

<p>Does it not seem as if we were reading an anticipation
by eighteen hundred years of that hymn which moderns
so often raise to the power of steam and to the great
ocean liners which cross the Atlantic in five or six days?
But ours is only a brief illusion. The wonder and the
admiration of Pliny are soon over, and a sort of awe
takes their place. “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Audax vita, scelerum plena!</i>” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
quickly adds. “Creature full of wicked daring!” The
invention of sails seems to him almost a sacrilegious
impiety, and his view was that of all the ancients.</p>

<p>In short, the few victories which the ancients had
won over nature were to them a cause of embarrassment
rather than of enthusiasm; for they saw in them
merely a proof of the perversity and foolhardiness of
human pride. If a contemporary of Sophocles or
Horace came back to the world, he would probably
just at first be terrified by what he saw all round him,
as by the spectacle of a gigantic and unheard-of madness.
Machinery, which to us seems the most marvellous
instrument of our energy and intelligence,
appeared to the ancients a danger, an enemy, and
almost a sacrilege: an attempt to rebel against the gods
and their wishes. Consequently, they invented and
adopted machines—and those but simple and primitive
ones—only for use in war, especially for siege-work.
The necessity of conquering made them forget to some
extent their usual fears.</p>

<p>So great a difference in thought and feeling, in a
matter which to us seems of such vital importance,
must arise from deep-seated causes. Why did the
ancients invent and construct so few machines, and hold
in such fear the few they had? Why did they wish the
hand of man to be the principal and the most powerful
among the instruments of production? Many attribute
the inferiority of the ancients in this department to the
comparatively undeveloped state of science. Vast and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
profound knowledge of science, they say, is required
for the construction of modern machines. The ancients
did not possess this knowledge; therefore, they conclude,
they could not construct the machines.</p>

<p>But, in this deduction there are two exaggerations.
The services of science, especially in early times, to
machines and their progress, are exaggerated; so also
is the scientific ignorance of the ancients. Science has
helped materially to perfect certain machines, but has
actually invented scarcely one. Many of the marvellous
machines which, at a giddy rate, multiply riches
all round us, have been conceived for the first time in
the minds of artisans, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">contre-maîtres</i>, managers of factories,
and other persons more expert in practice than
rich in scientific lore. The founder of the great mechanical
industry, Arkwright, who invented the cotton-spinning
machine, was a barber. Watt, the inventor
of the steam-engine, though perhaps a better-educated
man than Arkwright, was not in any sense a great
scientist. For the rest, whoever knows the history of
machinery is aware that science did not begin to concern
herself with machinery, or to inquire whether her
studies might help inventors with useful suggestions,
until the great mechanical industry had already invaded
the world. Science, then, only followed a movement
which had already begun, and did not give it the first
impulse.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the scientific ignorance of the ancients
is exaggerated. Ancient science is not so well-known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
as ancient art and literature; and it certainly did not
make very striking progress during the last brilliant
period of ancient history—the Roman Empire. Therefore
to many, whose knowledge regarding it is comparatively
superficial, the ancient world may seem empty
of scientific wisdom. But such is not the case. If the
Romans never applied much thought to the scientific
study of nature, the Greeks for their part had laid the
foundations of many sciences, and had laid them
boldly and truly. Even the Copernican system had
been anticipated by Greek astronomers, like Aristarchus
of Samos and Seleucus of Seleucia, who had maintained
that the earth revolved round the sun, and that the
firmament was much more vast than was generally
supposed.</p>

<p>We need not, therefore, believe that the ancients
were not able to construct more complicated machines
than those they used, because they lacked scientific
knowledge. It would be nearer the truth to say that
they did not make much effort to raise sciences out of
the necessarily narrow domain of purely theoretical
problems, because, independent as they were of machinery,
they had no need of the practical aids which
science, if developed in certain directions, can lend to
the construction of machines. In fact, we men of the
present day encourage the sciences to search and investigate
in every direction and to try every path, not
from a disinterested love of the True nor from an
intellectual curiosity to spy out the mysteries of nature;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
but because we hope that we shall discover, in the
course of our all-embracing search, laws or bodies or
forces which will help us to subdue and exploit nature.</p>

<p>The ancients then abstained from inventing and
constructing machines, not from lack of knowledge but
from lack of will. The effort seemed to them useless,
nay, pernicious; and the enterprise did not attract
them. It remains, therefore, to consider why the
ancients, in their great struggle to extend the dominion
of man over nature, felt no need of help from swift
engines of iron, and, therefore, did not make the effort
necessary to invent them. This is a question of the
highest importance for the history of civilisation, for
by its solution only can we gain an insight into what is
perhaps the most profound difference between ancient
and modern civilisation. The difference consists in
this: while our civilisation is a mechanical-scientific
civilisation, the ancient was above all things an artistic
civilisation. Therefore our civilisation tends in the
main to multiply the needs and the consumption of
man, so as to quicken production as much as possible,
while the ancient civilisation tended to limit man’s
needs and consumption, to hold up to esteem and
imitation customs of simplicity and parsimony which
involved a reduction in consumption, and therefore in
production. If we are to grasp the very essence of our
history, we must understand clearly how indisolubly
united are the artistic civilisation and
the ideal of a simple life, the mechanical-scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
civilisation and the ideal of a life of extravagance
and luxury.</p>

<p>Even at the present day, many will be found to extol
the greatness, the wealth, and the might of the Roman
Empire as a marvel never surpassed in history. But
this is a delusion. The Roman Empire seemed marvellously
wealthy and powerful to the ancients, because
they had never yet seen greater wealth and greater
might. But what are the wealth and the might of
the Roman Empire compared with the might and the
wealth of the great modern states of Europe and
America? One observation will suffice to give an idea
of the difference. We are justified in deducing from the
great number of facts and data in our possession that
in the most flourishing and wealthy centuries the
budget of the Empire, the sum total, that is, of all the
items of expenditure which the central government at
Rome had to meet—expenditure on the most important
public services of so immense an empire, which
comprised the whole basin of the Mediterranean, and
a large part of Europe, Asia, and Africa—fell short, far
short, of the municipal budget of the city of New
York. Only the man who is conversant with the
customs of the past in their minutest details can
fully estimate how much simpler, poorer, and more
economical the civilisation of the ancients was than
that which has permeated America and Europe
since the invention of the steam-engine and electricity,
when the riches of the New World, exploited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
intensively with the help of machinery, began to
flood the earth.</p>

<p>Consuming little, and content with a life of simplicity
and poverty, the ancients had no need to produce
much or to produce at great speed. So they had
no requirement for machines, whether steam- or electricity-driven.
The few simple machines, which the
hand of man or the muscular force of domestic animals
can operate,—the domestic loom, the horse-propelled
mill,—sufficed. Therefore, they had no need of science
to help them to construct new machines of greater
size and power. They had no need to work at high
pressure. They could work slowly, with their hands
and with a few simple instruments, and with them produce
beautiful, accurate, and finished articles, which
aspired to a lofty and difficult ideal of perfection.
Accordingly, art occupied in the ancient world the
position which science occupies in modern civilisation.
It was not a refined luxury for the few, but an elementary
and universal necessity. Governments and wealthy
citizens were obliged to adorn their cities with monuments,
sculptures, and pictures, to embellish squares,
streets, and houses, because the masses wished the cities
to be beautiful, and would have rebelled against an
authority which would have them live in an unadorned
city; just as nowadays they would rebel against a
municipal authority which would have them dwell in
a city without light, or against a government which
placed obstacles and hindrances in the way of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
construction of railways. In those times, the requirement
was that everything, down to the household
utensils, even of the most modest description and
destined for the use of the poorer classes, be inspired
with a breath of beauty. Anyone who visits a museum
of Greco-Roman antiquities, in which are exposed to
view objects found in rich and highly cultivated districts,—that
of Naples, for example, where so many
objects excavated from the ashes of Pompeii are to be
seen,—can easily convince himself of this curious
phenomenon, and realise more vividly, by contrast, the
carelessness, roughness, and commonplace vulgarity of
the objects made by modern machinery. In short, if
the quantity of the things produced by the industry
of the ancients was small, for that very reason, and
by way of compensation, their quality was refined and
excellent.</p>

<p>The contrary is the case in the modern world.
The quantity of the things which modern industry,
thanks to electricity- and steam-driven machinery,
produces, is prodigious. No century ever witnessed
the realisation of the miracle of abundance in a
more marvellous way. But the quality of the things
suffers in consequence. The ugliness and the crude
vulgarity of so many objects, which in much poorer
times had an elegance and a beauty which have now
vanished, are the price we pay for the abundance of our
times. The necessities of man have increased beyond
all measure, and to satisfy them lavish and rapid production<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
is required. The need for rapid production
accounts for the invention of so many machines. But
it is not possible to secure the manufacture by rigid
hands of iron of so many things at such speed, and at
the same time to impart to them an exquisitely artistic
appearance, revealing the personal excellence of the
artist. It is as much as we can do to impart to them a
coarse and rude appearance of beauty, with a few
ornamentations copied casually from the beautiful
things which our fathers succeeded in creating in
poorer and less busy times. Machinery, driven by
steam or electricity, has the advantage of speed over
the hand of man. It can produce in the same time a
much greater number of objects. For this reason it has
triumphed in a time like ours, in which the increased
necessities of the world demand an extraordinary
growth in production. But the hand of man,—that
living and mind-inspired machine,—if it cannot compete
with machines of iron for speed, is alone capable
of imparting to things that perfection, that grace, and
that excellence of form which can fill us with a joy
which is different from, but perhaps more intense than,
that afforded by easy and coarse abundance.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>This contrast between ancient and modern times,
between the civilisations which preceded the French
Revolution and the modern American civilisation, should
and would have received more attention than it has,
had not the students of antiquity been too prone to lose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
their way in the maze of a dead erudition. We are
proud of our wealth and power. We are proud of
having extended our dominion over the whole planet,
only a small part of which was known to the ancients,
and that but vaguely. We are proud of having surprised
so many of nature’s secrets, of having deciphered
the mystery of so many laws, of having thrown light
on so many lurking-places of disease and death, of
having shaken ourselves free from so many vain fears
which tormented our ancestors, of having released
ourselves from so many yokes—political, moral, and
intellectual—which used to weigh upon their necks.
We feel ourselves strong, sure of ourselves and of our
destiny as no men before us in history, in face of the
blind forces of the Universe, so many of which we have
subjected to our dominion and forced to serve our
necessities, our ambitions, and our whims.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the midst of all this wealth, this
power, and this knowledge, a dull sense of disquietude
vexes men’s souls. Man is not yet content. Every day
he finds new pretexts or motives for complaining. One
of the most oft-repeated of these pretexts or motives is,
that the world is becoming uglier. If in our cities any
beautiful part remains, it is nearly always the old part.
In the historical cities, the new parts are horrible, and
form a strange contrast with the older. The altogether-new
cities—especially those which have sprung up in
the last century in America—appear to the artistic eye
almost always like a sort of anteroom to the infernal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
regions. Architecture has become a mother of monsters.
Sculpture and painting, which were once upon
a time the two most select amongst the decorative arts,
protected and pampered by the great ones of the earth
and adored by the masses, are reduced to the necessity
of employing a thousand artifices to extort orders out
of the negligent malevolence of an epoch, whose ornaments
and monuments seem an encumbrance and an
excrescence rather than a beauty. There was a time
when the dress of men and women was a work of art.
At the present day, only that of women has preserved
a certain artistic grace and beauty. Let us not
dwell upon the countless other forms of ugliness which
have invaded our houses with the furniture, the carpets,
the candelabra, and the china.</p>

<p>The artistic mediocrity of our epoch is surpassed only
by the superficiality and confusion of its tastes. Each
succeeding year sees that which used to appear the
height of elegance and beauty to its predecessors, despised,
neglected, and forgotten. All the styles of the
past and all the styles of the different countries swirl
round us, before the fickle gusts of fashion. Every
picture which excites admiration for a moment is
quickly forgotten by the fickle taste of an age which
ransacks every corner in search of the beautiful, because
nowhere can the beautiful be found. Many ask
themselves what is the origin of this strange corruption
of taste and of the æsthetic sense. But no two people
agree on the answer. This one attributes the degeneration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
to the decadence of traditions, and therefore
proposes to open schools and to institute courses of
instruction. That one, on the other hand, traces the
responsibility to the lack of liberty afforded the public
taste and the genius of the artists, a condition of things
for which these same traditions are to blame. Such a
one therefore inveighs against the schools and the rules
of tradition, and would like to see them all swept away.
Nobody can explain how it happens that so rich, so
wise, and so powerful a civilisation does not succeed in
being beautiful, and shows itself powerless to infuse a
breath of beauty into anything it creates, be it big or
little, into its cities or into the small objects of daily use.</p>

<p>But the history of civilisation explains this apparent
mystery. A civilisation cannot deck itself with the
most exquisite beauties of art, if it cannot persuade
itself to live with a certain simplicity and to work with
a certain deliberation. What kills art in our civilisation
is the mad desire for wealth, the giddy increase of
necessities, the universal craze for speed, the effort to
multiply production, the general restlessness of body
and mind. Beauty is not so simple and commonplace
a thing as to admit of its examples being multiplied by
machinery in furious haste. Whether in big things or
in little, it can only be the result of a long and steady
effort of the intellect and the will, which must be expressed
at all costs through the medium of that living
and marvellous machine, the human hand. If we wish
to accumulate round us the wealth of the world at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
express speed, if we wish to produce and to consume
with giddy rapidity, we must not be too exacting in our
demands for quality and beauty in the things produced.
We cannot have a great deal in this world, and have
that great deal beautiful.</p>

<p>Therefore, speaking still more generally, we might
say that in the ancient civilisation the dominant principle
was quality, in the modern civilisation, on the other
hand, quantity. In ancient times, the more cultured,
powerful, and wealthy a nation became, the greater
efforts it made to produce in every branch of human
activity but few things, but to ensure the materialisation
in those things of a difficult and lofty ideal of
perfection which should find common acceptance and
admiration. Men of our time, on the other hand,
direct their efforts towards production in large quantities,
and at great speed, and are proud of seeing their
power and grandeur expressed in the formidable figures
of modern statistics. That the goods produced are of
deteriorating quality is of small account. Thus the
ancient civilisations tended, so to speak, towards
eternity, towards the manufacture of things which, if
not eternal in the precise meaning of the word, should
last a long time, should conquer the ages, and should
succeed in conveying to distant posterity a supreme
image of their past existence. In very truth, after
numberless catastrophes and pillagings, the material
remains of ancient civilisations, which are piously
preserved to this day, are very numerous. Our age produces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
in great quantities, but maybe not a single one
of the buildings and material objects produced by it in
such abundance can hope to conquer the ages. Everything
is precarious, ephemeral, destined to live a few
months or a few years; destined to a premature death
from the very first hour of its birth.</p>

<p>And this diversity crops up again in every branch of
human activity; in industrial as in intellectual activity,
in art as in literature. We look upon the literatures of
Greece and Rome as a treasure of inestimable value,
almost as the foundation of our culture; and we still
recommend them as models to all who wish to learn the
difficult art of writing and of speaking with precision,
elegance, and clearness. And yet how little the ancients
wrote and read compared with ourselves! The press
did not exist; paper, now the cheapest of materials, was a
rare luxury—the papyrus was a most precious Egyptian
monopoly. Consequently, the number of persons who
could provide themselves with books was very small,
and such persons were found only among the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> of
culture or of wealth. The only opportunities of reading
the people had were afforded by the public notices, and
by the laws engraved on bronze or marble tablets. In
those times, there was nothing to correspond in any way
at all with the newspapers of to-day. In view of the
very scanty numbers of the readers of books, those also
who wrote them were bound to be few in number; these
could not write much. With but very few exceptions,
the works bequeathed to us by the ancients are by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
means voluminous. Of all the qualities commonly found
in Greek and Latin writers, sobriety and conciseness are
the most prominent. These virtues were to some extent
the product of circumstances. For in times in which
paper was so dear, and every copy of a book had to
be prepared specially by an amanuensis, conciseness
and brevity were the two qualities of importance to
insure the wide circulation and preservation of a book.</p>

<p>It was, however, just the circumstance that the ancients
wrote so little that enabled them to carry the art
of writing to an indescribable pitch of perfection; that
enabled them to obtain that clearness, that harmony,
that cadence and proportion of phrase, that concentration
which has made them the great masters of the
literary art for all time. And to-day!—A wolfish, insatiable
hunger for printed paper and reading matter is
the scourge of our civilisation. Look at the Pantagruelian
literary orgies to which Europe and America
surrender themselves! Every day brings its daily paper,
every week its journals, illustrated or otherwise, every
month its reviews and magazines. Then we have the
special publications devoted to a particular art, a
particular profession, a particular industry, a favourite
sport, in number without end. We have, too, the
volumes of every kind and quality with which a crowd
of publishers congests the book market: novels, poems,
books of travel, science, political economy, religion,
sport. Who could enumerate all the kinds of books
which are published nowadays? Many of these, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
true, do not find readers, but many do; and a certain
number, so many readers as to be sold in thousands, in
tens of thousands, and to be scattered broadcast all
over the world.</p>

<p>But to satisfy a public which is so greedy of reading,
an extraordinary number of writers is required at the
present day, from the obscure editors of provincial
journals to the favoured few who succeed in winning
world-fame, and in reaching the position of sovereigns
or, if you prefer it, satraps of literature. And all this
enormous multitude of writers is compelled to write
prolifically and rapidly, because the public wants to
read voraciously. It must choose diverse topics, and
vary its themes according to the varieties of fashion and
events. On the other hand, it is no longer compelled
to be concise, both because the public often likes prolixity,
which makes reading comfortable and easy, and
because, nowadays, printing is so cheap and facile.
But the art of writing is being lost through this haste,
this instability of public interest, this prolixity. Every
tongue is becoming a muddy mixture of words and
phrases which have dripped from every point of heaven
on to the daily language and literature. Taste is being
corrupted, with writers as with readers, deteriorating
now into negligence and carelessness, now into affectation
and grotesqueness.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Quality and quantity: these are the two principles of
the two civilisations, the ancient and the modern.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
They are two opposite principles, a circumstance which
explains why in the last fifty years the gradual triumph
of the civilisation of machinery or of industry on a large
scale, which aims at multiplying the quantity of riches,
has been accompanied by a decline in classical studies.
The new generation, even that portion of it that represents
the educated classes, has broken away from the
study of a world which, though resembling the modern
world in so many of its ideas and institutions, differed
from the present era in the fundamental conception of
life, and professed an entirely different idea of perfection.</p>

<p>However, if the two principles are mutually exclusive,
we must ask ourselves, which is true and which false,
which is good and which is not. Who is in the right,—we,
who wish to fill the world with riches, even at the
cost of disfiguring it and making it hideous; or the
ancients, who were content to live a life of greater simplicity,
of more leisurely and more peaceful activity,
but wished to spend it in a persevering effort to materialise
their ideals of beauty? In how many of the
confused disputes which set the men of our times by
the ears is this problem obscurely implied, though the
disputants are unaware of it? But the problem is a
terrible one, because it involves all the fundamental
problems of contemporary life and the very destiny of
the gigantic operations to which our own generation,
and those which preceded it, have applied themselves
with such frenzied activity.</p>

<p>So I will not attempt to solve the formidable problem.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Yet may I be permitted to express a thought, simple in
itself, but one which presents itself with the smiling
countenance of hope. It is, that “opposite” principles
do not mean “irreconcilable” principles. Is it not
just possible that this craze for work, for riches, and for
speed, of which we are victims, may slacken somewhat,
and give men time to collect their thoughts, and to
piece together again the shattered grandeur of the
modern world in the image of a more serene and composed
beauty? Are men really doomed to become
more insatiable, the richer they become; or will the
day arrive when they will think it wiser to employ a
larger part of the immense riches they possess, not in
producing other riches, but in embellishing the world,
seeing that beauty is no less a joy in life than wealth,
and that we ourselves, though all athirst for gold, prove
that it is so, by searching untiringly in every corner for
the few remains of ancient beauty?</p>

<p>I feel that I have not the courage to answer this
question with a brutal “No”; and I hope that many
others will be of the same opinion. For one cannot
help thinking that one of the most marvellous epochs
in history would really begin on the day on which
Europe and America succeeded in reconciling in a new
civilisation the two opposite principles of quantity and
quality, and in employing the extraordinary riches at
their disposal in adorning and beautifying the world,
which their energy and audacity have so immeasurably
enlarged in recent centuries.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Some</span> years ago, in the course of the excavations
which are being made with such success in Egypt,
a papyrus was found which is now known among
archæologists by the name of <i>The Petition of Dionysia</i>.
This papyrus, which belongs to the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>,
contains on one side some books of the <i>Iliad</i>, on the
other a defence presented by a certain Dionysia to an
Egyptian court, before which she was defending an
action brought against her by her own father affecting
her dowry and other questions of interest. To escape
paying his daughter and her husband the sums which
they demanded, the father had directed the husband
to return him his daughter, and had dissolved the
marriage. But the daughter, on her side, maintained in
her defence that the father had forfeited his right to
dissolve her marriage and to separate her from her
husband, because her marriage was a “written” marriage—established,
that is to say, by an act or document
in writing. If it had been an “unwritten”
marriage, Dionysia would not have contested her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
father’s right in that case to dissolve it, for no motive
whatever, merely because it so pleased him.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine a document more
strange than this, from the point of view of the ideas
which prevail at the present day in European and
American society. Matrimony is for us an act of so
great social importance that the state alone—that is to
say, the law, and the law courts—can recognise or
dissolve it. To leave the destiny of a family at the
mercy of the will of the father of one of the two parties,
to recognise as his the right to destroy a family at any
moment to suit his individual interest, without being
accountable to anyone for so doing, would seem to us a
monstrous thing. And yet this monstrous thing seemed
to the whole of antiquity, with few restrictions and
reservations, legitimate, reasonable, and wise. Differences
in the organisation of the family existed in
different countries and in different centuries; but they
were but superficial, unessential differences. On one
point, the whole world agreed: that matrimony should
never be considered an act to be left to the will of the
contracting parties, but a business transaction which
the young people should leave to their fathers to arrange.</p>

<p>Matrimony, as it was in Rome, will serve to give a
clear idea of the ancient world’s conception of the
family. In Rome, fathers often betrothed their sons
when they were still children. They made them marry
when they were still quite young, the males before they
were twenty, the girls at about sixteen; and they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
the right to oblige them at any moment to divorce each
other, without being forced to give any reason or
explanation. A man might be an exemplary husband,
might live with his wife in the most perfect bliss. If
the son’s wife, for one reason or another, did not suit
the fancy of his father, the son might be obliged any
day to put her away. Amongst others to whom this
happened was no less a person than Tiberius, at a time
when he had already become one of the first figures in
the Empire, and had commanded armies in battle. He
had married a daughter of Agrippa, and loved her
devotedly. The couple were considered in Rome a
model of affection and faithfulness. But, at a certain
moment, Augustus, who was the adoptive father of Tiberius,
judged that for political motives another marriage
might have suited Tiberius better; and he, accordingly,
obliged Tiberius to divorce her. Tiberius was so much
upset, that—as Suetonius tells us—every time he met
his first wife in society, he burst into tears—he, who
was one of the most formidable generals of his time;
so that Augustus had to take measures to prevent their
meeting each other. And yet Tiberius had to give way;
for his father, in the eyes of the law and in accordance
with the ideas current in his time, was absolute arbiter
in these matters! Not even a man in the circumstances
of Tiberius, who had already been consul, could think
of rebelling against the paternal authority.</p>

<p>These few facts suffice to prove how often the ideas
which to one epoch and to one civilisation seem the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
most natural, the most evident, and the most simple,
are, on the contrary, complex and difficult ideas, at
which mankind has arrived only after a long effort, and
weary struggles. Is there anything which seems to us
more reasonable than to leave to young people, who
wish to found a family, ample liberty of judgment and
of choice in the matter of the person with whom they
will have to pass their lives? Fathers, it is true, often
help their sons by giving advice. They readily place
at the disposal of their children their own experience.
But it is only in very rare instances that they maintain
a struggle <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à outrance</i>, to withhold their children from a
marriage on which their hearts are set, or to force on
them a repugnant alliance. We consider that the
individual’s happiness may depend to some extent on
his marriage. It is, therefore, just that everybody
should have ample liberty of choice. If the law purported
to restore to fathers the right to make or unmake
their sons’ marriages, we are convinced that at the
present day the vast majority of fathers would refuse
to assume such a responsibility, and would consider
such a power unjust, excessive, and tyrannical. There
is not a father to-day who, however averse he may be
to a marriage desired by his son or daughter, does not
end by telling him or her, provided a little firmness is
shown in resisting his arguments, that after all it is not
he, but his son or daughter who has to take the husband
or wife in question. Indeed, this inclination to pliability
on the part of fathers towards their sons is increasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
every day. Every day sees a growing disinclination
on the part of fathers to fetter, in a matter of such delicacy
and of such importance to the personal happiness
of the young, the freedom of the latter’s inclinations,
the spontaneous rush of their feelings. Besides, what
would be the use of having conquered liberty in so many
other spheres, if it were withheld in this which, especially
to the young, seems the most important of all: the
liberty of yielding to the impulse of that passion which
at a certain moment of life is the strongest of all, love?</p>

<p>And yet no idea would have appeared more absurd
and scandalous to the men of the ancient world, the
contemporaries of Pericles and Cæsar. The difference
is so radical and profound that it must arise from important
reasons. In fact, whoever compares ancient
with modern times easily recognises that the rights of
sentiment and the principles of liberty have been able
to triumph in modern society only by virtue of a complete
transformation in social customs and ordinances,
which has stripped the family in our times of much of
its social importance. To-day the family is purely and
simply a form of social life in common. Man and
woman cannot live solitary lives. A powerful instinct
impels them towards each other. Even when the
instinct is not felt, or is spent, the man needs to live in
the company of other human beings, to have round
him a circle of persons with whom he may find himself
in relations of the closest intimacy. To-day the family
performs this profoundly human office—this office and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
practically no other. Nowadays, man and woman
study, work, take part in government, compete for the
conquest of wealth and power, and exercise an influence
on society—engage in all these activities quite
outside the family.</p>

<p>But it was not so in ancient times. The family was
then an independent economic organisation, in which
the woman had a predominant part. She wove and
spun, providing every member of the family with
clothes. She made bread, she dried the fruits for the
winter, she seized the right moment for laying in the
necessary supplies of provisions—a most important
task, in times in which commerce was much less developed
than it is now. In poor or moderately wealthy
families, the women wove and performed similar tasks
with their own hands. Rich women learned to do these
tasks as children, but later contented themselves with
superintending their performance by women slaves or
freedwomen. But, especially in the rich families, the
woman could contribute a great deal to the prosperity
or the ruin of the house, according as she was or was
not active in the performance of her work, zealous in
her surveillance, energetic and shrewd in giving her
orders, moderate in her expenditure. Even to-day the
woman can contribute a great deal, in the wealthy
classes, to the prosperity of the family. But for this
she requires only one negative virtue, for all that this
virtue is not too common or easily acquired: to know
how to confine her expenses within reasonable limits,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
and not to be too ready to gratify her whims. In
ancient times, on the contrary, if a woman was to be
useful to her family she needed as well a positive virtue:
to know how to produce much and well. This explains
how we come to know that certain emperors’ wives,
Livia for instance, directed the weaving operations in
their homes personally and with great zeal, and that
Augustus was particular not to wear any togas but
those woven in his house under the eyes of his wife.
The Emperor and his wife by their example meant to
recall to all the Roman women the duty of attending
with zeal and alacrity to their domestic duties.</p>

<p>The ancient family, especially among the upper
classes, was also a school. The ancient world had few
institutions of public education; and private instruction
did not reach a high level of development, except in the
closing years of the Empire. Though Rome was the
greatest military power in the world, the family took
the place of military schools, which were then non-existent.
The officers, who all belonged to the nobility,
were prepared in the family. The father was the first
military instructor of his sons, and on him fell the duty
of making good soldiers of them. This, indeed, was
one of the reasons why the aristocracy became indispensable
to the Roman Empire; because it alone could
prepare the officers and generals in the family.</p>

<p>In short, the ancient family was a sort of political
society. Its members were bound to support and help
each other in difficult and dangerous contingencies, to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
much greater extent than they are nowadays. In
political struggles, for instance, they were all of one
colour. It was the most difficult and unheard of thing,
if indeed not impossible, for a son or a son-in-law to
attach himself to a different political party from that of
his father or his father-in-law. If a member of the
family was implicated in a lawsuit, or financially embarrassed,
the family was bound to help him much more
energetically, and at much greater risk, than in our
day. We see this phenomenon most clearly in Roman
history. After the aristocracy split into two opposing
parties,—the conservative and the popular, to borrow
modern expressions,—a man’s position in one or the
other party was determined, almost always, by his
birth. He belonged to one party or the other, according
as his own family belonged to one or the other.
Take Cæsar, for example. Why was Cæsar always
a member of the democratic party, and bound to
follow its vicissitudes, to the extent of becoming its
leader and occasioning a civil war, overturning the
ancient government, and establishing a dictatorship
which, reviving as it did the saddest memories of
Sulla’s reaction, could not fail to be odious to the
majority, and which was the cause of Cæsar’s death?
It was not the result of any special inclination or ambition
of his own. Several times he tried to cross over to
the other party, which had much more power and
authority; or at any rate, to reach an understanding
with it. But his effort was of no avail. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the nephew of Marius, the most celebrated among the
leaders of the popular party, and the one whom the
other party most detested. The first impulse towards
the whole of the great dictator’s extraordinary career
was given by this relationship; he had in the end to
bring about a second revolution, because his uncle had
already caused one.</p>

<p>It is easy then to understand for what reason, in
times in which the family performed so many social
offices and was the pivot of so many interests, marriage
was not considered as an act to be left to the full discretion
of the young and to their love, and why the
fathers were conceded the right to decide for themselves
in such matters. A marriage involved grave
political, economic, and moral responsibilities for the
members of both clans. Therefore the young people
were required to sacrifice to the common interests of
their clan some part of their personal inclinations.
In compensation, they had the advantage, in case of
danger and of need, of being able to count on the family
much more than they can nowadays; the family arrogated
to itself, it is true, certain rights in connection
with their choice, but in return did not abandon them
to their fate in the hour of need.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In short, the ancient marriage, organised though it
was on lines which appear to us tyrannical, presented
certain advantages which, if considered carefully, will
be seen to compensate, at least in part, for the restricted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
liberty of choice. In the great transformation of civilisation
of which the modern marriage is the product,
men have, it is true, gained, on the one hand, greater
liberty, but have lost, on the other, certain advantages
which, in the ancient world, were guaranteed to them by
the closer and more vigorous solidarity of the family.
Women, on the contrary, have gained much more in the
passage from the ancient to the modern world, because
in exchange for what they have gained, they have lost
practically nothing. The organisation of the modern
family is distinguished from that of the ancient especially
by the much greater concessions it makes to
the woman. Feminists complain loudly of the present
condition of woman. It is certain, however, at least to
anyone with any knowledge of the history of the past,
that at no epoch have women been so little oppressed
by men and at no epoch have they enjoyed so many
advantages as at present.</p>

<p>In fact, if in the ancient marriage so little liberty of
choice was reserved to the man, it is easy to understand
that not a ghost of it was conceded to the woman. The
man had in addition one advantage. Constrained to
submit to the will of the father as long as the latter was
alive, he became, when the father died, absolute master
of his wife, because he could then repudiate her and
marry another, how and when he chose. The almost
unfettered liberty of divorce, without any motive, or
for the most futile motives, might well be some compensation
to the man for the subjection in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
father, while alive, kept him. For the woman, there was
no compensation at all. As long as her father lived,
she had to obey the man to whom her father gave her.
When the father was no more, she still remained in the
power of her husband, who could not only repudiate
her without any motive, but even marry her to another.
In the history of Rome, especially, the men used and
abused this privilege in a way, which to us seems sometimes
ridiculous, sometimes revolting, and always extravagant.
Especially in the last century of the republic,
when the struggles between the parties became intense,
the most eminent statesmen adopted the habit of consolidating
their alliances with marriages. Therefore,
we see every political vicissitude of importance shrouded
in a curious web of divorces and marriages. Now one
great man hands his wife over to another, now he
marries the other’s daughter, now gives him his sister
to wife. The poor women wander from one house to
the other, change husbands from one year to another,
with the same facility with which, nowadays, a traveller
changes his inn. For all these marriages lasted only as
long as the political combination on account of which
they were entered into. When the combination was
dissolved, divorce broke up all or most of these families,
and the husbands set themselves to contract new
marriages. It was so easy for the husband to get a
divorce. He needed only to write his wife a letter
announcing his intention!</p>

<p>Life, then, was bound to be not over-agreeable in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Cæsar’s time for an affectionate, delicate, virtuous
woman who desired the quiet joys of family life. When
we contemplate from afar the historical grandeur and
the glory of ancient Rome, we ought not to forget the
multitude of hapless women which Rome was forced
to sacrifice—a precious holocaust indeed—to her fortune
and power. How many women’s broken hearts,
how many women’s shattered lives went to make up the
foundations of Roman grandeur! Nevertheless, even
the greatest evils are never without some small admixture
of good; and that sorrowful plight of woman in
ancient times, especially of the Roman woman, was
offset by one advantage of which liberty has robbed
the woman of to-day. That is, that in ancient times, a
woman, whether fair or plain, clever or foolish, attractive
or insipid, was certain to be married, and that too
while she was still young. The husband could not
choose her; but she was sure of finding him, and that
without undue delay.</p>

<p>In fact, nowhere in the ancient world do we find any
striking traces of a feminine celibacy like that which
existed later under the influence of Christianity in the
convents, or like that which is to-day again coming into
prominence for social and economic reasons, without
any religious impress or need of monastic vows, especially
in the great industrial countries. It seems that
women of the upper and middle classes, if they were not
positively deformed and physically unsuited for matrimony,
all married. Furthermore, inasmuch as marriages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
especially among the upper classes, were
arranged from political and social motives, no account
was taken of the beauty of the bride, but of her social
position, her family, and so on. Historians always tell
us how many wives the numerous prominent figures in
Roman history married, and to what families they
belonged. But it is rare for them to tell us whether they
were beautiful or ugly, intelligent or stupid, pleasing or
unpleasing; these details seemed to them of but trifling
importance. One of the few exceptions to this rule is
Livia, the last wife of Augustus. All the writers vie in
celebrating her rare beauty (to which the statues also
bear witness), her wisdom, intelligence, and virtue. But
Livia seems really to have been a miracle; for it is a fact
that, having married Augustus in her earliest youth,
she succeeded in living with him all her life.</p>

<p>Fifteen or sixteen years was considered the suitable
age for a bride. Sometimes girls were married when
they were barely fourteen, while nowadays it is rare
for a girl to marry before she is twenty, and the
majority marry between the ages of twenty and thirty.
Furthermore, in many states of the ancient world the
legal age for matrimony, both for the woman and the
man, was much lower than it is to-day in European and
American legal codes. This is not surprising. In all
times and in all places in which matrimony is considered
not as a personal matter of sentiment, but as a
social act which must be regulated and directed by the
parents, the object is to marry off the young people as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
quickly as possible. Often they are actually betrothed
when they are still children, and share each other’s
games of running and jumping. This was a fairly
common practice in ancient Rome amongst the nobility,
as it is a thriving custom in the China of to-day.
Nor is it difficult to understand the reason for this procedure,
which, considered by itself, seems to us extravagant
and senseless. Love in all times and in all places
is a most intractable passion. It is, therefore, more
easy in such matters, for the elders to impose their wills
and cold-blooded arrangements, on girls of fourteen or
fifteen and boys of seventeen or eighteen, than on
women or men of twenty-five. Naturally such precocious
marriages, contracted between young people
who had not yet had a taste of the world, were not free
from dangers and serious inconveniences. But these
dangers and inconveniences appeared to contemporary
eyes less great than those which would have arisen, if
the young had been left to follow the dictates of their
own feelings.</p>

<p>In conclusion, another advantage which the ancient
marriage, with all its many hardships and its want of
sympathy, assured to the woman was what one might
call the legal protection of virtue. Nowhere was this
protection greater and stronger than in ancient Rome.
In Rome, the legitimacy of a marriage did not depend,
as it does now in Europe and America, on the fulfilment
of certain formalities before a priest or a magistrate,
but on the moral situation of the woman. An <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ingenua<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
et honesta</i> woman, to use the expression then current,
meaning a free-born woman of irreproachable habits,
could live with a man only in the capacity of his legitimate
wife. No formality in the presence of any magistrate
was required. The fact of living with a man and
being <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ingenua et honesta</i> sufficed to assure to a woman
and her own children all the rights appertaining to a
wife and to legitimate offspring. On the other hand, a
woman who had lived a dissolute life, had engaged in
certain employments considered, and justly considered,
disgraceful for a woman, or who had been convicted
of adultery, could never become a legitimate wife or
enjoy the privileges and rights of a legitimate wife.
There was no ceremony before a priest or magistrate
which could make a legitimate wife of her. She was by
law a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">concubina</i>, and in that capacity for a long time had
no rights. Only in the course of time could she hope to
get the rights, much restricted and of little importance
as they were, which the law gradually conceded to the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">concubina</i>.</p>

<p>To transport this ancient conception of matrimony
into modern society would doubtless not be possible,
because it contradicts the great democratic principle of
the equality of all before the law, on which our social
organisation rests. But considered by itself this ancient
conception of matrimony is without a doubt more
lofty and more noble, and in particular more favourable
to the woman, than the modern one. For it did not
reduce the status of legitimate wife to what is practically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
a formality, but made it the exclusive privilege
of the virtuous woman, and therefore assured the
virtuous woman of a kind of privileged legal position,
protecting her effectively against the intrigues and
seductions of the attractive and gay women who, in the
modern régime, are usually the more dangerous to the
peace and happiness of the virtuous women, the less
austere are their habits. In ancient Rome, the law
guaranteed the virtuous woman that at least no one of
these women should be able to rob her of the post of
honour which she occupied in the family.</p>

<p>The comparison of the ancient marriage with the
modern marriage once more proves to us, then, how
complex are human affairs, and how difficult it is to
pass an absolute and definitive judgment upon them.
Certainly, at first sight, the condition of the woman in
the ancient family seems to us a horrible one, resembling
that of a slave. We wonder how nations that had risen
to a lofty level of social, intellectual, and moral development
could have tolerated it. But when we consider
the matter more attentively, we find that even this
condition, wretched though it was in certain respects,
was not without certain advantages, which may perhaps
explain to us why women put up with it for so
many centuries. The liberty which the woman of the
present day enjoys has countless advantages; but it has
made matrimony for her a struggle, in which, if some
triumph, others are worsted, and those who triumph
are not always the most virtuous and the most wise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
Also, in this order of things, liberty is an excellent thing,
especially for the fortunate and the brave; but the
fortunate and the brave, where marriages and love are
concerned, are not always those who possess the qualities
which conduce most effectively to the progress of
the world and the improvement of the human species.
Modern liberty has set a high price on beauty and
intelligence in woman, which is all to the good; but it
has also made coquetry, frivolity, and vapidity into
qualities which are useful for the conquest of man, who
is not always a reasonable being and is even less reasonable
than usual when he is in love—which is <em>not</em>
all to the good. For there is no doubt that between
twenty and thirty years of age a man is much more
sensitive to the attractions of a frivolous and seductive
girl than to those of a serious and sensible woman.</p>

<p>All human things, then, have their advantages and
their disadvantages, and that perhaps is why the world
never tires of its experiments in diverse directions and
on every topic. Absolute perfection is unattainable—a
fact which should make us careful not to boast too
loudly of the times in which we live, nor to be too ready
to disparage what preceding generations have done.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LESSON OF THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap l"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span class="smcap1">“L’histoire</span> est un recommencement perpétuel</i>,” a
French writer has said. If the forms in which
history manifests itself are infinitely various, the forces
which inspire it are always the same, and are everywhere
at work, on a large scale or on a small, openly or
secretly. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that
the decadence of the Roman Empire is being repeated
in our time in the modern world.</p>

<p>This assertion may seem paradoxical and strange.
What! are we moderns on the downward grade? Why,
one hears of nothing but progress on every side. Never
was there an epoch more proud of its loudly vaunted
achievements. The sciences are adding discovery to
discovery. The wealth of the world is increasing with
giddy rapidity. Comfort and culture are spreading in
every class and in every country. One after another,
most recondite treasures of the earth are falling
into our hands. We are gradually fighting down all the
forces of nature which for so long a time kept our
ancestors at a distance, impeded them, even threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
them with death, from the law of gravity to the most
insidious maladies. Is it permissible to talk of decadence
at the very moment when man has made
himself lord of the whole earth, and is even learning to
fly? History cannot show a richer, wiser, more powerful,
more daring epoch than the present one. No wonder
that most people would resent the suggestion that we,
in the flush of our brilliant successes, are seeing the
repetition of that ancient and terrible history of the
last centuries of the Roman Empire, which was one of
the saddest and deadliest episodes in the world’s history.</p>

<p>And yet that history is repeating itself, to a certain
extent at any rate. The showy wealth and the noisy
triumphs of modern civilisation veil, but do not hide,
this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">recommencement de l’histoire</i> from him who studies,
in a spirit of philosophy, our times and the decadence
of the Roman Empire. It is true that there are immense
differences between the two civilisations and the two
epochs. But notwithstanding these differences, what
wonderful resemblances there are! Consider especially
that disease which corrupted the trunk of the Roman
Empire, and which is beginning slowly, subtly, insidiously
to eat the heart out of the modern world.</p>

<p>The disease which killed the Roman Empire was, in
fact, excessive urbanisation. Neither the attacks of
barbarism from outside, nor those of Christianity from
within, would have prevailed against its might and its
massive weight, if the strength of the colossus had not
been already undermined by this internal cancer. But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
slowly and steadily, the disease had spread through the
trunk of the Empire, and had attacked its most vital
organs one after the other, fostered on its deadly errand
by wealth, peace, art, literature, culture, religion, all
the blessings which men most long for and most prize.</p>

<p>In order to understand this extraordinary phenomenon
of Roman history, we must hark back to the
generations that lived quietly and in a relatively happy
state in the flowery times of Rome’s real power and
greatness. After two centuries of war, at the beginning
of the Christian era, peace was finally established in the
great Empire which Rome had conquered. In the days
of peace, the barbarian West learned from the Romans
how to cultivate the earth, to cut the forests, to excavate
the minerals, to navigate the rivers, to speak and
to write Latin. It became civilised, and bought the
manufactures of the ancient industrial cities of the
East. Every fresh market of the West, as it was
opened up, gave a stimulus to the ancient industries of
the East, which found in such market a new clientèle.
Contact with the barbarism of the West rapidly gave
fresh youth to the old civilisation of the East,—Egypt,
Syria, Asia Minor,—which had decayed somewhat in
the great crisis of the last century of the republic.
Everywhere fresh lands were brought under cultivation,
methods of agriculture were perfected, minerals
were searched for, new industries and new branches of
commerce were opened up. Prosperity and luxury
preceding in every nation, even the most barbarous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
and in every class, even the poorest, which acquired a
taste for the luxuries of civilisation.</p>

<p>An epoch of rapid increase of wealth, of lucky enterprises,
of frequent, close, and varied commercial and
intellectual intercourse between the most distant
peoples, began. In every part of the Empire, in Gaul
as well as in Asia Minor, in Spain as well as in Africa,
these new trades, these new industries and agricultural
enterprises gave rise to a prosperous middle class and
to provincial aristocracies,—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nouveaux riches</i> families,—which
gradually came to form the governing class of the
Empire, migrated to the cities, strode to enlarge them,
to embellish them, and to make them more comfortable,
reproducing in every part of the Empire the splendours
of the urban civilisation after the Greco-Asiatic model
as perfected by the practical Roman spirit of organisation.
In every province, the example of the Emperor
in Rome found imitators. In the first and second centuries,
every rich family spent part of its possessions on
the embellishment of the cities, and made provision for
the common people of profits, comforts, and pleasures:
they built palaces, villas, theatres, temples, baths, and
aqueducts. They distributed grain, oil, amusements,
and money. They endowed public services and assumed
the rôle of pious founders.</p>

<p>The Empire covered itself with cities great and small,
rivalling each other in splendour and wealth; and into
these cities, at the expense of depopulating the countryside
where nobody was willing any longer to live, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
attracted the peasantry, the village artisans, and the
yeomanry. In these cities, schools were opened in
which the youth of the middle class were taught
eloquence, literature, and philosophy, and trained for
official posts, the number of which increased from generation
to generation, and for the liberal professions.
Thus, in the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, the Empire spread, in
the sun of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pax Romana</i>, which illumined the world,
its countless marble-decked cities, as our time spreads,
in the sun of modern civilisation, the confused and
smoky opulence of its cities, large and moderate-sized,
crowded, disordered, a blaze of light by night, bristling
with chimneys and shrouded in black fog by day. In
other words, the most important phenomenon in the
whole history of the Roman Empire, during the first
two centuries of the Christian era, is, as in the nineteenth
century, the rapid growth and enrichment of the
cities.</p>

<p>The phenomenon was not then so rapid nor on so
large a scale as it is to-day; not a single city in the
Empire, not even Rome, ever attained, in my opinion,
a population of one million inhabitants. The cities
which seemed big in those days would be only of
moderate size now. Populations and riches were
smaller. But the phenomenon in itself was the same.</p>

<p>From the third century onwards, the excessive urbanisation
in the Roman Empire, which had been the
cause of the splendour and apparent wealth of the
preceding century, began to change into a dissolving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
force, which drove that brilliant world back into the
chaos from which urbanisation had evolved it. Little
by little, the expenditure of the urban civilisation, the
cities and their increasing luxury, out-distanced the
fertility of the countryside, and, from that moment,
the latter began to be depopulated and sterilised by the
cities. With each succeeding generation, the impulse
towards the cities became stronger. The numbers and
the requirements of the modern population increased.
The State and the wealthy classes were inundated with
requests, prayers, and threats, urging them to satisfy
these requirements, to adorn and enrich ever more and
more the cities, which were the glory and splendour of
the Empire.</p>

<p>In order to feed, amuse, and clothe crowded city-populations;
to carry through the construction of the
magnificent monuments whose ruins we still admire;
to provide work for the industries and arts of the cities,—agriculture
was, little by little, ground down by ever-increasing
burdens. The position of the peasant, in the
solitude of the depopulated countryside, became ever
more sad and gloomy, just as the cities became fairer,
bigger, fuller of amusement and festivals. The impulse
towards the cities increased, and one day the
Empire awoke to find that its cities were swarming with
beggars, idlers, vagabonds, masons, plasterers, sculptors,
painters, dancers, actors, singers—in short, the
whole tribe of the artisans of pleasure and of luxury.
But in the fields, which were expected to feed all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
men who had crowded into the cities to work or to idle,
there was a dearth of peasants to cultivate the land.
Also, with the disappearance of the rural population,
the problem of recruiting the army, which drew its
soldiers then, as always, from the country, became
increasingly serious. While the cities tricked themselves
out with magnificent monuments, the Empire
was threatened with a dearth of bread and of soldiers.</p>

<p>It must be owned that the Empire struggled against
this menace with desperate vigour. It introduced the
villeinage of the soil. It tried to bind the peasants to
the land. It established heredity of trade or calling.
But the effort was fruitless. Aggravated by one of the
most tremendous intellectual blunders in the annals of
history, the crisis became insoluble. The agriculture
of the Empire, and with it the Empire itself, received
its death-blow. The East and the West split apart, and,
left to itself, the West went to pieces. The greatest
of the works of Rome, the Empire founded by her in
Europe, including the immense territory bounded by
the Rhine and the Danube, lay a vast ruin: a ruin of
shattered monuments, of peoples relapsed into barbarism,
of perished arts, of forgotten tongues, of laws
thrown to the four winds, of roads, villages, cities
razed from the face of the earth, swallowed up in the
primeval forest which slowly and tenaciously thrust
out its tentacles, in that cemetery of a past civilisation,
and entwined the giant bones of Rome!</p>

<p>But the reader will say: “But that is not happening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
and never will happen, to contemporary civilisation.
Even if it cannot be denied that there is a certain
analogy between the history of the first two centuries
of the Empire and that of modern times, the analogy
stops short at this point. The world will never witness
another catastrophe like that of the Roman Empire;
or at any rate, nobody now alive will witness it.”</p>

<p>I heartily concur in this opinion. Modern civilisation
will resist the ills which assail it better than
ancient civilisation resisted them. But it will be able
to do so because it is stronger, not because it does not
contain within itself the germ of the cancer which
destroyed the Roman world. Many symptoms prove
this. I will dilate upon one of them only, the most
serious, the most salient, the most generally recognised
and felt, even though few up to the present have seen
in it an analogy and a resemblance to the great historical
crisis of the fall of the Roman Empire. I refer
to the rise in the cost of living.</p>

<p>To-day, Europe and America resound from one end
to another with a chorus of complaints from men and
women who have to live in the cities. Rent, bread,
milk, meat, vegetables, eggs, clothes—everything, in
short, is rising in price. Even people in the thirties
can remember having witnessed times of fable, a kind
of mythical golden age, in which things were worth
practically nothing compared with their price to-day.
Governments are besieged with entreaties, threats, and
prayers to provide supplies, but they do not know how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
to do so. What is the cause, what the remedy, of this
strange phenomenon? Some lay the blame on the
taxes; some on Protection; some on the merchants and
speculators.</p>

<p>And indeed, at first sight, the phenomenon seems
inexplicable. At no period of history was there such
a determined rush to make money as at the present
time. No age had at its disposal so many and such
effective means of making it. The men of to-day are
obsessed to such an extent by the frenzy for work that
they no longer have time to live. Statistics tell us in
exact figures the yearly increase in the production of
the world. So the earth ought to be wallowing in
abundance, an abundance such as the world has never
seen heretofore. How comes it, then, that men everywhere
complain, and most loudly in the richest countries,
of the intolerable dearness of everything? What
is the object, what the effect, of the work of the man of
to-day, if not abundance but scarcity is the recompense
of daily toil?</p>

<p>This scarcity is a graver and more complex phenomenon
than those who most complain of it suppose,
and is not the fault of government or traders. It is a
veritable <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">recommencement de l’histoire</i>, and the study
of the Roman Empire can be of the greatest service in
helping us to understand it. It is the first serious,
universally felt symptom of that excessive urbanisation
which was the ruin of ancient Rome. This modern
society arises from the over-development of the cities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
from the too rapid increase in the needs and luxuries
of the multitudes who live in the cities. Men and
money concentrate in the cities, and swell the urban
industries and luxury, public and private, intent on
putting into operation all the marvels which the fertile
modern genius, inspired by competition in the race for
progress, is continually inventing. The countryside,
on the other hand, has in the last half-century been
left too much to itself, and agriculture has been too
much neglected, exactly as began to be the case in the
Roman Empire at the beginning of the second century
of the Christian era. It is easy to guess what must be
the natural consequence of this lop-sided arrangement.
The cities grow bigger; industries increase in number
and in size; the luxury and the needs of the masses,
crowded together in the cities, augment. On the other
hand, there is no proportionate increase in the productiveness
of the land. And so the increase in wealth
is accompanied by an increasing scarcity of the fruits
of the earth; and the things which serve to clothe and
feed us—cotton, linen, hemp, wool, cereals, meat,
vegetables—nearly all rise in price much more than
do manufactured goods. This explains the scarcity
that vexes the cities in proportion to their growth in
size.</p>

<p>In no country is this phenomenon more apparent and
interesting than in the United States. Which of the
nations of the world could more easily revel in the most
marvellous abundance of everything which it is possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
to conceive? The United States has no lack of territories
to cultivate; or of capital, which accumulates
every year in immeasurable quantity; or of strong
arms, Europe providing her with immigrants in the
prime of life; or of the spirit of enterprise and of
untiring energy. And yet, in no country of Europe are
complaints of the expense of living more generally and
loudly raised than in the United States. Why? Because
in America the disproportion between the progress
of the country and that of the cities, between
industrial progress and agricultural progress, is even
greater than in Europe, the home of populations which
for centuries have been accustomed to a country life.
Consequently the scarcity is greater and more vexatious
in the United States, because the wealth of that country
is greater than that of Europe.</p>

<p>Someone will say: “However that may be, if this
scarcity which we are experiencing is the most obvious
symptom of the excessive urbanisation from which our
civilisation is suffering, the suffering cannot be a very
serious matter; it must be far from assuming the grave
and dangerous aspect which it bore in the time of the
Roman Empire. So in this respect also we can consider
ourselves lucky; this excessive urbanisation does not
cause us more than a certain material uneasiness,
which is felt by the middle and lower classes in the
cities. In the Roman Empire, on the other hand,
it produced a historical catastrophe.” All that is true,
without a doubt, but precisely on this account ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
the lesson, with which the history of the fall of the
Roman Empire is pregnant, to be read and pondered.</p>

<p>In the Roman Empire, too, for a long time, just as
now in Europe and America, this excessive urbanisation
only occasioned a by-no-means intolerable material
uneasiness to the most numerous and poorest classes of
town-dweller. In the first and second centuries,—that
is to say, in the two most prosperous and splendid centuries
of the Empire,—numerous inscriptions remind us
of gifts made by rich citizens or precautions taken by
the cities to meet the scarcity of victuals which pressed
hard upon the poorer classes. It is scarcely necessary
to mention Rome in this connection, so notorious is the
fact. From the day when it became the metropolis of a
vast Empire, the scarcity of victuals became a permanent
feature of the city; and the State had to furnish
the city with the famous <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">frumentationes</i>, which were,
in the last two centuries of the Republic and throughout
the Empire, one of Rome’s most serious preoccupations.
Mistress of a mighty Empire, Rome was for centuries
sure of being obeyed in the most distant provinces by
the people that her sword had conquered; but there
was never a day in the year when she was sure of
keeping the wolf from the door!</p>

<p>In the Roman Empire also, then, for a long time the
excessive urbanisation made itself felt in the shape of a
troublesome, but by no means intolerable, rise in the
cost of living in the cities. Why did it gradually bring
about a terrific social dissolution? Because the Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Empire, instead of leaving its cities to fight down this
evil, tried to abolish it by artificial means; and those
artificial means it applied ever more and more extensively,
the more serious the evil became. The crisis of
the cities of the Empire began in the third century,
which saw the depopulation of the countryside, and the
diminution of agricultural production, while in the
cities, on the other hand, victuals were rising in price,
and the number of beggars was increasing in a most
alarming way. If the State had allowed this crisis to
run its natural course, what would have happened?
Of course things would of themselves have regained
their equilibrium little by little. Part of the urban
proletariat, unable to live in the overcrowded cities,
and seeing themselves condemned to a sort of chronic
famine and gradual extinction, would have returned
to work in the fields. When the drain on the population
of the countryside becomes too great, the evil
admits of only one remedy: and that is, that life in the
cities should be allowed to become unbearable to a
certain number of the citizens, so that they may be
tempted to exchange it for life and work in the fields.</p>

<p>But the Roman State could not bring itself to let the
evil follow its natural course. The large cities, beginning
with Rome, had too great influence with the
Government; and throughout the Empire the city
beautiful and rich had come to represent the model of
civilisation. Little by little, the State let itself be persuaded
to do for each of its cities what it had done for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
Rome ever since its earliest conception of a world-policy
under the delusion that it could thus stave off
the impending crisis. With a view to easing the misery
of the urban proletariat, it took public works in hand
in every direction, regardless of their utility. It distributed
victuals free or at half-price. It multiplied
philanthropic institutions and encouraged the wealthy
families to imitate and to assist it. But all these
schemes cost money, which the State could secure only
by increasing the taxes on agriculture, while the
wealthy families had to spend in the cities the bulk of
the wealth which they derived from their country
property. The result was that life was artificially made
easier and more comfortable in the cities, and harder
and more difficult in the country, whereas the natural
trend of circumstances would have produced the opposite
effect. The evil, treated in so ridiculous a way,
became worse. The exodus of the peasants into the
cities increased, and brought a corresponding increase
in the demands on the public purse for the amelioration
of the conditions of city life. The intensification of the
evil was met by an increase in the dose of the very
remedy which aggravated it—useless expenditure in
the cities, ruinous taxes on agriculture. Matters went
from worse to worse, until the system reached the
limit of its elasticity, and the whole social fabric collapsed
in a colossal catastrophe.</p>

<p>This is precisely the mistake which modern civilisation
must learn to avoid. The catastrophe of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
Roman Empire teaches us moderns one lesson: and
that is, that the evil from which the great cities of the
civil world are suffering at present is a salutary, health-giving,
and beneficent visitation. For it puts a natural
brake on the growth of cities and of their luxury, and
keeps the population in the fields, where the rise in
the price of living brings profit, greater comfort, and
improved living in its train. It is, in short, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vis
medicatrix naturæ</i>, which tends to restore the balance
between agriculture and industry, between the city
and the country, a balance which the development
of modern civilisation has upset. Therefore all the
artificial measures which pretend to mitigate this evil,
at the very moment when the force of circumstances
demands that this development shall stop, must be
pernicious. While they tide over a trifling evil of
the moment, they lay up for the future troubles and
difficulties and dangers of infinitely greater gravity.</p>

<p>Even if modern civilisation adopted in its entirety
the policy pursued by the Roman Empire, and tried to
eradicate the evil with the same deadly artificial measures
which only aggravated it, there would still doubtless
be no ground for fearing a catastrophe in the future
analogous to that which overwhelmed Greco-Roman
civilisation. Modern civilisation is too vast, too powerful,
too deep-rooted, to have any fear of a similar fate.
But if not destroyed, modern civilisation might be
profoundly shaken and weakened in the event of its
imitating the policy of Rome and seeking to favour the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
cities overmuch at the expense of the country;—all the
more shaken and weakened, because, dazzled as we all
are by the triumphs of the world in which we live, and
by the surface marks of its powers and grandeur, it is
much more difficult for us than it was for the ancients
in a similar case to discern the signs of old age in it,
and the cracks which are spreading in the edifice in
which we live.</p>

<p>There is a further lesson to be learned by us moderns
from the history of the decadence of the Roman Empire:
and that is, not to mistake the glamour of the
external manifestations of wealth and power for signs
of real wealth and power. A civilisation is not always
in reality richer and stronger in times when it bears
the most visible marks of so being; we are rather apt to
find that, when it is most dazzling in outward seeming,
its decadence has already begun. We often halt in
stupefaction and admiration before the great ruins of
ancient Rome, especially those offered by the European
provinces of the Empire. We think how great, powerful,
and rich must have been the Empire which could
rear monuments so massive that all the centuries have
not been able to sweep them entirely from the face of
the earth. And yet, if we are to look at these relics in
their right light, we must remember that practically
all the great Roman monuments whose remains survive
to our day on a large scale, belong to the third, fourth,
and fifth centuries of the Christian era—to the centuries
of decadence and dissolution. As the Empire weakens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
and ages, its monuments become more and more
elaborate and colossal. A fairly safe rule for guessing
the century to which Roman monuments belong is to
assume that the more imposing the ruins, the later is
the epoch to which they should be attributed.</p>

<p>For Rome herself, the time of the greatest expansion,
splendour, and population was the middle of the fourth
century—that is to say, when her decadence was already
far advanced. Not till then did Rome become, for the
number and size of her temples, the magnificence of
her baths, her basilicas, and her private palaces, for the
beauty of her public gardens, for her size and population,
the first and most marvellous city of the Empire:
the portent which evokes the admiration of the whole
world. How much smaller, on the other hand, how
much more simple and modest was she in the first
century, a time when the Empire really was at its most
flourishing epoch, with its frontiers safe, its population
on the up-grade, its cities developing themselves by a
process of growth which was still a perfectly natural
one, agriculture, trade, and industries in a sound condition,
and the State well organised and strong.</p>

<p>Nor is this a historical paradox. It is only what
always happens to a greater or less extent. In families
as in nations and civilisations, ostentation, display, the
doing on a grand scale everything, even what might be
done on a small scale without detriment, or even
advantageously, are a sign of decadence rather than of
progress. The passion for the colossal and the enormous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
is not a healthy passion, nor does it flourish in epochs
of strength and sound moral and social equilibrium; it
is a passion which thrives in epochs of decadence, epochs
convulsed by a deep-seated disproportion between desires
and reality, a thirst for excitements and violent
sensations, lavish in the expenditure of labour and of
wealth to procure a fallacious illusion of grandeur and
power, spurred on by a spirit of rivalry and of competition
which easily degenerates into false pride.</p>

<p>Not the least of the causes contributing to the maintenance
and increase in the ancient cities of that sumptuousness
of festivals, ceremonies, and monuments which
gradually ruined the Roman Empire was the rivalry
between the big, the medium-sized, and the small cities
of the Empire, between provinces and districts, between
classes, families, professions, sects, and religions. When
a city built a theatre, or baths, or a basilica, at once her
sister-cities wanted one too, as big or bigger. If a rich
family built or endowed a temple or baths, the other
families wished to do the same or more. There was a
continual competition between the religions to have the
finest temple or the most sumptuous ceremonial. That
explains why a little city like Verona, for instance,
has an enormous amphitheatre, in which the whole
population of the city could be accommodated several
times over. That explains why the provinces, the cities
and private individuals, in this competition of display
and magnificence, all showered enormous wealth on
that display, wealth which would have been better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
spent in defending the Empire or in preserving its
economic resources. Many of those remains which
evoke our admiration to-day meant, in the days when
they reared their proud bulk to the sky, the ruin of the
Empire!</p>

<p>And now let us search our own consciences. Can we
honestly declare that our epoch is untainted by this
mania for grandeur and display, this spirit of sterile
public and private rivalry, which caused the ancient
Roman Empire to squander such vast treasures, and
cloaked its fatal decadence with a vesture of splendour?
I cannot suppose that our freedom from such taint
would be maintained by anyone who remarked the
headlong growth of public and private luxury, the ever
swelling vanity of nations, professions, and classes, the
tendency to mistake in everything the grandeur of
colossal proportions for the grandeur of intrinsic virtue.
Whoever casts his eyes around him, in America as well
as in Europe, sees this impression gaining ground on all
sides and acquiring force. It fouls the stream of
politics, religion, literature, philosophy and art. It
corrupts or transforms the spirit of the upper as well
as of the lower classes. Not only that, but there is
a prevailing tendency to consider this impression a
sign of force, a proof of greatness and of progress. The
history of Rome admonishes us, then, to distrust this
illusion, and to sound the spirit of our civilisation to its
deepest depths—that spirit which to us seems a limpid
mirror of perfection, while it is really very much the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
opposite. If, after twenty centuries of work and study,
we find ourselves, fortunate heirs of an ancient civilisation,
in a position to live more safely and more comfortably
than did our ancestors on this little globe, we
are not, therefore, justified in altering the moral values
and virtues to suit our pleasures. The vices, the faults,
the depraved inclinations of twenty centuries ago remain
the same to-day and modern civilisation would be
guilty of the gravest of errors if, deaf to the great lesson
preached by the ruins of Rome, she boasted of those
very defects which destroyed in the ancient world one
of the greatest works of human brain and energy that
history has to offer.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> are always talking about progress. But does
“progress” mean only the multiplication of
wealth and of the power and speed of machines, in
other words, of our mastery over nature? This would be
a rash assertion. “Progress” implies further improvement
of, and increase in, the virtues, and the diminution
of the vices inherent in human nature. Now, can anyone
who knows the history of ancient civilisation, the
life, the customs, the ideas, and the moral outlook of the
Greeks and Romans, say that we have become better
than they? And if he can say so, how much better have
we become? Have we become better in every department
of life, or are there some things in which we show
a falling-off?</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that we are braver than the
ancients. Our control of fire has obliged us to be continually
making calls upon our bravery. The formidable
machines which we set in motion; the explosives
which we use so largely; the murderous forces of nature,
like electricity, which we have brought into subservience;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
the thousand dangerous exploits on the sea, in the
bowels of the earth, and in the giddy heights of the air
in which thousands, nay millions, of engineers and
workmen daily risk their lives, have steeled our
temperaments to quell that blind and instinctive fear
which lies deep down in human nature.</p>

<p>War is the supreme test of this increased courage.
War has become rarer, it is true, than it was in the
ancient world; but how much more terrible and awe-inspiring
has it become, both by land and by sea, since
fire replaced steel as the principal weapon! The only
forms of fire known to the ancients as useful in war
were boiling oil, which was often used in sieges, and
the so-called Greek fire, which was employed in naval
battles—a mysterious compound, into which one suspects,
petroleum entered, for it was much used by the
nations and cities of the Black Sea. But both of these
were but children’s toys compared with the guns,
shrapnel, and torpedoes of modern warfare. We are
justified, therefore, in asserting that the men who took
part in the battles of Marathon, Cannæ, and Zama did
not need to have hearts so stout or courage so intrepid
as the men who faced each other in the great battles of
the Napoleonic era, in the American Civil War, in the
battles between the Russians and Japanese, or in the
recent Balkan War.</p>

<p>But if we are more courageous, we are at the same
time less cruel, a fact which throws our superior courage
into greater relief. One of the characteristic differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
between contemporary civilisation and those which
preceded it, up to the French Revolution, is the total
suppression of the bloody spectacles which, under so
many aspects and forms, were one of the most sinister
delights of our ancestors. We find the greatest difficulty
in understanding how so highly civilised a people as the
Romans, with so many thoughts and feelings in common
with ourselves, could have been roused to such a
pitch of intoxication by the games of gladiators and
the baiting of wild beasts. And yet the popular passion
for these bloody games was such that even the emperors,
in whom they inspired feelings of horror and repulsion,
like Augustus, were compelled to attend the gory
spectacles, so as not to appear, by their absence, to
rebuke those who supported them and to run counter
to the absorbing passion of the masses for them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if an ancient Roman came back
to the world, and saw an American stadium packed with
people from top to bottom, he would be not a little
puzzled to explain what could have induced so many
thousands of persons to have flocked together from afar
merely to watch a football match,—to collect in such
crowds, endure such a long journey, and such discomfort,
just to get a distant view of some youths kicking
their legs in the air! It would seem to them a truly
insipid and tiresome spectacle. Their tastes ran to a
gory struggle, reminiscent of war, to fights between men
and animals, blood in bucketfuls.</p>

<p>Christianity initiated that education of men’s feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
which has made us gradually turn away our eyes
in horror from these atrocious diversions. But how
slow and difficult this education has been! It can safely
be said not to have reached its climax until after the
Revolution. Only the nineteenth century, intent on
mitigating and humanising the penal law in every
direction, has finally succeeded in abolishing the last
of these cruel spectacles, capital punishment. Right
up to the end of the eighteenth century, condemned
prisoners were executed throughout Europe with much
pomp and in the full light of day, in the central squares
of the cities, at times and places at which everybody
could attend, as if at a public festival. Indeed, executions
were invariably attended by an immense public,
attracted by cruel curiosity to see a man going to his
death. By diminishing the number of death sentences,
and by executing culprits in prison yards in the presence
of a handful of witnesses, or, as is still done in France,
in public, but at dawn, with the public kept at as great
a distance as possible, the nineteenth century has put
the crown on one of the most far-reaching and wonderful
moral transformations of the human mind, a
transformation which owes its birth to the words of
Christ uttered twenty centuries ago, and has given
modern civilisation one notable reason for boasting
itself superior to the ancient.</p>

<p>But if we are more courageous and more humane, we
are, on the other hand, in no way more sober or more
temperate. As far as these virtues are concerned, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
ancient world cuts a much better figure in history than
does the modern. We have deteriorated. The modern
world eats and drinks to excess. It indulges to excess
in alcoholic drinks and stimulants. The only intoxicating
drinks known to the ancients were wine and beer,
and wine they always drank mixed with water. They
did not know alcohol, nor consequently, liqueurs, now
so numerous and so highly appreciated; they did not
know tea, coffee, or tobacco. We can assert positively
that drunkenness was the rarest of vices in the ancient
world, while frugality was the commonest of virtues.
We need not take too seriously those orgies of the
wealthy to which ancient writers—especially Latin
writers—so often allude, or the banquets at which
dishes of parrots’ tongues were served, or pearls dissolved
in vinegar were drunk. These stories bear a
strong family likeness to the legends current in Europe
about “the corrupt state of American society,” and
are due to the same tendency. They are the exaggerated
and violent reaction of an ancient puritanism
against the natural advances of luxury and against that
kind of moral slackening which always accompanies
the increase of wealth. Just as the dispassionate and
unprejudiced European, when he examines at close-quarters
the so-called “corrupt state of American
society,” readily recognises that the high-sounding
expression only indicates certain defects and weaknesses
which certainly are reprehensible, but which are
common to the whole of modern civilisation and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
peculiar to America, so the famous Roman orgies and
the banquets, which have made so much stir, would
seem to us, if a miracle allowed us to attend them, very
modest and unassuming affairs compared to our
ostentatious displays.</p>

<p>As far, then, as sobriety and temperance are concerned,
we cannot confront our ancestors with too
haughty a mien. And what shall we say about the
purity of our customs? That is a much more difficult
problem, perhaps an absolutely insoluble one. At
least I, for my part, do not feel myself competent to
solve it. To judge from Greco-Latin literature and art,
one would say that in the ancient world, with the
exception of a few countries and certain epochs, such
as the centuries during which Rome was controlled by
a puritan aristocracy, the customs of both men and
women were very free and easy. But literature and
art often afford untrustworthy evidence on which to
base a judgment as to the customs of an epoch. For
vice, wrong, and crime, though they may shock the
moral sense, are more interesting subjects for art than
are virtue and honesty. In short, literature and art
always seek to describe what is rare, exceptional, and
dramatic. Therefore, if we wish to judge the moral
state of an epoch from its literature and art, we must
know how far and in what degree the faults and vices
described or chosen for artistic representation are common,
what is the rule, and how many are the exceptions.
And how are we to find this out? We shall have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
know the moral state of the epoch, and literature will
not help us to this knowledge.</p>

<p>Anybody who judged Paris from the novels or dramas
which deal with Parisian life would be forced to conclude
that the French metropolis spends the whole of
its time in amorous adventures. But anyone who
<em>knows</em> Paris is aware, what is after all an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> supposition,
that love occupies in its life a very much less
prominent place than in its literature; and that the
writers of dramas and novels go to love for their subject
by preference, because love admits of more attractive
treatment than do struggles for money or the
rivalries of political ambitions and the crosses of the
intellectual life. For the rest, when we wish to judge
the customs of an epoch or of a people, we must not
forget that it is not always the epochs or the nations
which lament most loudly the depravity of customs
that are the most corrupt. Far from it! Often the
epochs which bewail their own vices most bitterly
are those in which the moral conscience is still lively
and robust and, therefore, protests against the evil.
The epochs which are dumb, and seem most virtuous,
have often reached such a pitch of depravity, that they
have become indifferent to the evil.</p>

<p>A striking instance of this curious phenomenon is to
be found in the history of Rome. Horrible stories are
told of the first period of the Empire,—extending from
Augustus to Nero,—during which the family of the Julio-Claudii
were at the helm of the State. History and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
literature are full of scandals, and of laments over the
depravity of the times. In the second period, on the
other hand,—that of the Flavii and Antonines,—the
scandals and protests cease. The depravity of the
preceding century seems suddenly to have mysteriously
disappeared. The Roman world has, by a kind of
miraculous conversion, in a few years turned virtuous.
In fact, not a few historians have thought that this
miracle did come about, and have credited it to the
virtuous emperors of the second century. After so
many bad emperors, Rome at last got some good ones;
and the trick was done! But anybody who studies the
facts with a little patience will have no hesitation in
concluding that the times of the Antonines were at
least as corrupt as those of the Julio-Claudii; but that,
while in the first century of the Christian era the ancient
Puritan spirit of Rome was still alive and vigorous,
and therefore protested against the deterioration of
customs with such energy that its protests have reached
even to our ears, in the epoch of the Antonines, on the
other hand, this spirit was spent. Consequently,
everybody resigned himself to the evil, either despairing
of being able to cure it, or not giving it a thought.
And so, of the two epochs, that which was painted in
the blacker colours was, perhaps, really the better.</p>

<p>It is impossible, then, to decide whether our customs
are better or worse than those of the ancients. It is
certain, on the other hand, that we are much more
human than they. For with us, a sentiment, which with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the ancients was very weak, if not non-existent, is lively
and profound, the sentiment of the moral equality of
every individual. The ancients simply refused to recognise
in the slave and in the free man, in the nobleman
and in the plebeian, in the citizen and in the foreigner,
human creatures made of the same clay and animated
by the same spirit, whom the mysterious accidents of
fortune had placed in different situations, and all of
whom had certain sacred and inviolable rights in the
supreme domain of justice. A few philosophers dared
just to hint at such doctrines, but without laying too
much stress upon them. And theirs were voices crying
in the wilderness. The free man, the patrician, and the
citizen felt themselves creatures of another species and
of a higher nature than slaves, plebeians, and foreigners,
towards whom the former group might have capricious
bursts of benevolence, but to whom they never regarded
themselves as bound by any obligation. Hence came
that asperity which appears in all the social relations of
ancient peoples,—in their laws, their customs, their
wars, their political quarrels,—and which often seems
to us in so striking a contrast with the lofty and noble
culture which adorned the ancient states.</p>

<p>Augustus, for instance, was a grave, well-balanced,
and prudent man, who avoided all extremes. Yet the
ancient writers tell us to his credit that he had amongst
his numerous freedmen several men of the loftiest
intellect, of wide knowledge, and of transparent honesty,
who had rendered him great services; but that, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
he held them in great honour, he never invited any of
them to his table. Such an act of familiarity between
freedmen and patricians would have seemed to the
ancients derogatory, and so they praised Augustus for
having avoided it. To us, on the other hand, this attitude
of reserve on the part of the great Emperor seems
strange and incomprehensible, as it would seem on the
part of a great and wealthy manufacturer who was
ashamed to dine with the heads of departments of his
business.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the difference between rich and
poor was much less marked in the ancient world than it
is in the modern. This is, perhaps, the most striking
and important of the lines of cleavage between the
world of antiquity and that of to-day. The idea of the
moral equality of men, who are all sons of God, which
was disseminated by Christianity; the idea of political
and social equality, which was promulgated by the
French Revolution, have in modern civilisation cut at
the roots of the ancient distinctions of class, of religion,
and even to a certain extent of nationality. But modern
society is organising itself, in compensation, into
a hierarchy of wealth. Men may consider themselves
in theory all equal to one another; but each tries to
associate with those persons who have approximately
the same means as he, because it is they who are able to
have the same habits as he has. Precisely because the
modern world is so rich and so luxurious, the modes of
living among the richest, the rich, and the moderately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
well-to-do classes show striking differences. And what
is true of the modes of living is also true of tastes and
inclinations. Everybody realises nowadays that differences
or resemblances in habits, tastes, and inclinations
are what most attract and repel men and influence
them in treating each other as equals or unequals, when
custom and tradition have established no other moral
difference between them. The motor-car is as powerful
a barrier between the social classes of to-day as was
aristocratic prejudice before the Revolution.</p>

<p>In ancient times, on the other hand, precisely because
the world was then so much poorer and simpler, the
difference in the mode of living between poor and rich
was much smaller. Both lived in closer contact, treating
each other really as equals, provided always that
they were of the same rank socially and politically.
Augustus, who could not have freedmen, however
enlightened, to dinner, invited poor, but free-born,
plebeians. A rich Roman would never have entertained
a freedman in his house or at his table, or treated him as
an equal, even if the latter had been as rich as, or richer
than, himself. On the other hand, he welcomed and
treated as an equal a citizen free-born like himself,
however miserable and reduced to living on his bounty.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the ancient conception of the social
relations was less humane and less generous than ours,
it was not wanting in a certain moral grandeur that is
wanting to ours, inasmuch as in estimating a man, it
subordinated his wealth to ideal qualities, such as free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
birth, or good birth, or citizenship. So it maintained in
society certain moral values which were not to be
bought with money. The poorest of Roman citizens
was conscious and proud of possessing something of
inestimable value, which the richest and most opulent
of Roman freedmen could not acquire for all his
wealth; and this sentiment was a very real alleviation
of, and compensation for, his poverty. Dare we assert
that in this respect our social system does not fall short
of the ancient one? Such an assertion would be, in my
opinion, a very bold one. The gravest weakness in
modern society consists precisely in this continual increase
of the power of money, as an all-regulating force
and universal standard. If the social evolution which
we are witnessing continues on the path on which it has
started, in a short time there will be nothing in life
worth having which is not purchasable for money; and
then what means will there be left of bridling the greed
and envy of the poor?</p>

<p>But this superiority of ancient society was in its
turn the effect of a different conception of wealth, of
its rights, its duties, and its objects. It is an exaggeration
to credit the ancients with a simplicity and a contempt
for riches, qualities which serve as a strange
contrast with the greed and the insatiable thirst for gold
which possess the moderns. In ancient times, it is
true, men preached moderation in desires and taught
the art of being contented with but little, with greater
zeal and success than it is taught in modern times.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
Nevertheless, the men of those days, with but few exceptions,
were not less greedy than we, and not less apt to
consider wealth as the greatest of life’s blessings. Those
who could, accumulated large private fortunes with the
same frenzy and the same insatiate greed that inflame
so many speculators and business men of the present
day; and many of those who were content to live the
simple life were converts to this noble and lofty philosophy
from necessity rather than from conviction. The
wealth of the ancient world was infinitely smaller than
that of the modern world. Consequently a large number
of persons had to be content to live the simple life.
On this account the religions and the philosophers
invented many theories and doctrines to prove that
simplicity and parsimony were more desirable than
opulence and luxury. That is the reason for the
numberless theories regarding austerity that antiquity
invented.</p>

<p>But though the ancients desired riches as much as we
do, they were not infatuated by the desire to multiply
them to the same extent as the moderns. In this
respect, the ancients may truly be said to have been
more austere and disinterested than we. And the
difference between their thoughts and feelings on the
subject and our own is seen most strikingly in one
fundamental principle, which is, as it were, the keystone
of the whole fabric of ideas and sentiments which
concern riches; I mean, the question of putting money
out at interest. To modern society it seems the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
natural thing in the world that money should earn
interest. Nowadays, the number of those who lend or
invest capital in the countless ways offered by modern
finance is infinite. Every one of these big and little
capitalists, who possess State bonds, shares in railways
or industrials, or bank or commercial securities, would
be thunderstruck if anyone told him that he was behaving
in an unseemly way. Matters have reached a
point at which the distinction between investment and
usury is fading from our minds. And yet numberless
generations, and not a few of the most brilliant civilisations
in history, professed the idea that any business of
that sort was unbecoming. The ancients as a rule, with
but few casual exceptions, judged it unfitting for a man
of the respectable classes to earn money in any other
way than either from land and houses—realty—or from
direct participation in commerce and the arts; never
from money lent at interest to others. That was
usury; and was considered nearly always, with but few
exceptions of time and place, as the exercise of a degrading
profession. Wealthy men, with large sums of
money at their disposal, were able, and were expected, to
help those who needed money; but with gratuitous,
not with interest-bearing loans. The letters of Cicero,
for instance, are full of references to these gratuitous
loans, for which the great orator, when short of money,
often asked his friends. When he was in funds, he lent
to those who were in need. In short, the lending of
money without interest to upright and honourable persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
was considered in those days a duty of the rich.</p>

<p>Of course, ideas like these about money and interest
were bound to retard the development of the ancient
world and the increase of wealth. But they were ideas
which kept alive in men’s minds a certain noble disinterestedness
of which it would be difficult to find
traces to-day, and which makes amends for many of
the asperities of ancient civilisation.</p>

<p>Considering, then, the separate virtues one by one,
we find that in some we have progressed, in others we
have not. Therefore, in certain respects we are better
than the ancients, in others we are worse. Must we
conclude that the good and the evil balance each other,
and that, therefore, there has been no real moral progress
from the ancient world to the modern? That
would be, in my opinion, a very bold assertion. It is,
in fact, undeniable that our moral life is richer in principles
than that of the ancients, because we have retained
many of the ancient principles, and have added
to them the moral principles which were invented by the
civilisations which flourished after the fall of the Roman
Empire. We appreciate the virtues of patriotism, civic
affection, and valour in war which were proper to the
ancient cities. To them we add the sense of legality
and right, the need for precise and prompt justice,
which were invented by the ancient jurists and perfected
by the moderns. We add charity, mercy, love
of our neighbour, horror of cruel amusements, virtues
which Christ taught us. We add the sentiment of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
dignity and the rights of man, which was created by the
philosophy of the eighteenth century and by the French
Revolution. We add certain other brand-new sentiments,
the creation of the civilisation of machinery,
which are, therefore, stronger in America than in
Europe: ardour for the new, enthusiasm for progress,
confidence in our own strength. In war, we fight like
the Romans, and in peace, we turn our eyes away from
bloody spectacles. We should hold the gladiatorial
games in no whit less horror than the most pious of
Christian monks. We trade like the Phœnicians and
we love knowledge like the Greeks. We appreciate
liberty and we appreciate authority. Does not all this
constitute real progress? And does it not suffice to
counterbalance certain other defects of ours, such as
intemperance and the immoderate desire for riches?</p>

<p>I think so. But that does not mean that we are at
liberty to abandon ourselves freely to our vices and
defects, under the pretext that they are compensated
for by other virtues. It is the duty of every civilisation,
as of every man, to make himself as perfect as possible.
And this duty we must not forget, not even in the midst
of the immeasurable triumphs of the richest, most
powerful, and wisest civilisation that has ever yet seen
the light of day.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE AMERICAN DEFINITION OF PROGRESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> two visits I paid to South and North America
between 1907 and 1909 were the result of a lucky
chance, not of a prearranged plan. In 1906, after having
been plunged for ten years in the study of Roman
history, I had no idea of crossing the Atlantic, much less
of writing a book on America and Europe. I had never
dreamt that my long researches in the great cemetery
of the ancient world might start me suddenly one day
along the road which leads to the New World. But
destiny willed it so. In November of 1906, by invitation
of the Collège de France, I delivered in Paris a
course of lectures on the history of Augustus, in which
I summarised the fourth and fifth volumes of my
<i>Greatness and Decline of Rome</i>. There happened to be
at Paris at that time a distinguished Argentine, Señor
Emilio Mitré, son of that General Mitré who was one
of the Republic’s most conspicuous politicians during
the second half of the nineteenth century. He himself
was a man of importance in the political world, and
proprietor of the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Nacion</i>, which is not only the biggest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
most serious, and most authoritative newspaper in
Latin America, but one of the leading newspapers of the
world. I had contributed to this paper for years, so I
called on Mitré in Paris. He came to hear my lectures,
and the day before the concluding one, November
29th,—he was due to sail for Buenos Aires on December
1st,—he came to me with a proposal that I should go to
Argentina and there deliver some lectures. I accepted,
impelled chiefly by curiosity to see that vast and rich
country which, for the last ten years, had been so much
talked about in Italy, and to which during the last half-century
so many Italians had emigrated. I accordingly
prepared my lectures, and on June 7, 1907, I sailed from
Genoa for Buenos Aires with my wife and little boy.
Every European who crosses the Atlantic and can wield
his pen with any sort of effect writes his impressions
when he gets back. Naturally, therefore, I too had
promised several reviews and one publisher to bring
back with me a volume of “Impressions of Argentina.”</p>

<p>At six <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on June 8th, we put in to Barcelona.
Directly the steamer came alongside, the Brazilian
consul came on board in search of me. He handed me
a despatch from Baron di Rio Branco, the Brazilian
Minister of Foreign affairs, who invited me in the name
of the Brazilian Academy to stop at Rio, and read a
paper there. I begged the consul to telegraph to Baron
di Rio Branco that I could not stop on my voyage out,
as I was expected at Buenos Aires; but that on my
return I should be delighted to accept his kind invitation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
As the steamer was to put in at Rio, I could
arrange matters with him <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en route</i>. As the steamer
resumed her journey, and passed out of the Mediterranean
into the vast wilderness of the ocean, I busied
myself with some books of philosophy which I had
brought along, amongst them, some of Buddha’s discourses,
which had just been published in an Italian translation.</p>

<p>On June 24th, at 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, we reached the bay of Rio,
one of the most marvellous spots in the world. But
while we were gazing from the deck in admiration at
the gloomy mountains standing round about and the
woods which covered them, at the city rising from the
sea towards the mountains, and the roseate glow of
the setting sun upon the bay, we descried a steam launch
laden with people coming towards us. It was a deputation
from the Brazilian Academy and from the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, which was coming to take us for a
motor tour through the city, and afterwards to take
us to dinner at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where
Baron di Rio Branco was expecting us. We hastened
ashore, and found some motors waiting for us at the
Pharoux jetty. We jumped in, and were off.</p>

<p>As long as life lasts, I shall never forget that drive
at sunset, between the dying light of evening and the
first gleams of the electric lamps, which were just beginning
to light up the marvellous city built in the
midst of the remains of the primeval forest on the
borders of the sea, on the hills, and on the mountains.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
I shall never forget our dash through endless streets,
with hurried glimpses of multi-coloured houses, sumptuous
palaces half hidden in superb gardens, avenues of
gigantic palms which stretched far away into the
night, glorious promenades along the seashore, and
mountain peaks which beetled above the city. I
longed to stop the car. But time pressed, and after
having hurriedly traversed the whole city, we reached,
about 7.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, Itamaraty (as the palace of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs is called), where a select
company of men and women were awaiting us in rooms
ablaze with light. As soon as we had been introduced,
dinner was served; a most sumptuous dinner, into
which, among the most luscious ragoûts of the French
cuisine, the thoughtful Minister of Foreign Affairs had
introduced several Brazilian dishes. I remember the
<i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">palmiti</i>, a dish of palm-pith, cooked as we cook asparagus,
and really delicious; and <i>bakury</i>, a white fruit from
the equator, preserved in syrup, which reminded me
strongly of the smell of magnolia and gave me the
illusion of eating marvellous flowers.</p>

<p>Speeches followed the dinner, whereupon we returned
on shipboard, but before doing so I had arranged
in a corner of the drawing-room with Baron di Rio
Branco, Giuseppe Graça Aranha, now Brazilian Minister
at the Hague, and a distinguished writer, who was
then the Minister’s secretary, and Machado de Assis,
the great writer who was then President of the Brazilian
Academy, that I would stop a couple of months in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
Brazil on my way back, repeat my Buenos Aires
lectures, and visit the country. At 11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, the steamer
weighed anchor and left the dark bay, in which there
was nothing now to be seen but the glitter of an infinite
number of tiny lights.</p>

<p>That night, however, I did not sleep, so stunned and
dazzled was I by that first fantastic glimpse of America,
which will remain one of the most singular experiences
of my life, though, so far, my life has not been devoid
of strange and curious chances. I had started from
Europe with no, or practically no, knowledge of the
two Americas, excepting the little I had picked up here
and there in books and papers which I happened to
read. Consequently, my opinion of America was the
same as that formed by other Europeans: that it was
the country of material realities, of business, of fortunes
made rapidly, of wealth stripped of every ornament,
poetry, beauty, and ideal refinement; that rude and
bustling America with which all cultured Europeans love
to contrast Europe as the continent of the Ideal, where
beauty, wisdom, and every refinement of civil life
flourish. And behold! my first impression of America
was as of a strip of India, and the first American city
I had seen reminded me of the East, and especially,
for some reason or other, of Bagdad, or rather, of the
somewhat fantastic idea of Bagdad which I had conceived
in the days when I read more often and more
ardently than I do now, the <i>Orientales</i> of Victor Hugo,
and the other romantic poets of the middle of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
nineteenth century. And in that city, I had been present
at a succulent and magnificent banquet, at which,
amidst the refinements of the old civilisation of Europe,
I had tasted the unknown rarities of the tropics, in the
company of elegant, cultured, and refined guests, with
whom I had discussed in French the latest literary and
artistic novelties, as if we had been on the banks of the
Seine. Was it a reality or a dream?</p>

<p>Quite other surprises were, however, in store for me
on my wanderings in America. Four days later, on
June 27th, we reached Buenos Aires, where we were
joyfully welcomed by a number of kind folk, who had
spared neither trouble nor care to make our stay agreeable
to us. Then began four months of really strenuous
life, to borrow Theodore Roosevelt’s favourite expression.
Conferences, receptions, banquets, visits to hospitals,
schools, factories, workshops, and ranches; trips
by boat, train, and motor-car. It was a real <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">moto
perpetuo</i>. I passed the month of July at Buenos Aires.
In August, I plunged into the interior, visiting successively
Rosario, Mendoza, Cordova, Tucuman, Santiago,
dell ’Estero, Santa Fé, Paraná, and penetrating right
up to the foot of the Andes. I travelled about ten
thousand kilometres in the railway train, observing,
collecting documents, asking and answering questions,
and discussing problems. All these, however, were
labours less tiring than another, which became by degrees
the principal preoccupation of my mind during
those two months: the endeavour to put to flight a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
demon which kept obstinately springing up before my
eyes, in conversations, on journeys, during visits, during
dinner-parties, notwithstanding all the efforts I
made to keep it at a distance; and which seemed determined
to reappear at every moment and wound me in
the inmost recesses of my European pride and in my
most touchy European susceptibilities. What was this
demon? It was American progress. Every day I had
pointed out to me on my rapid journeys, immense and
marvellous ranches, herds of many thousand head,
markets overflowing with wealth, magnificent schools,
and superb hospitals. I was given descriptions and
demonstrations, in figures and in fact, of the rapid
spread of cultivation, the increase of production, the
bewildering prosperity of the banks, the expansion of
Buenos Aires, now become the second city of the Latin
world in wealth and population, after Paris. They were
all interesting things to observe and study. Nevertheless,
too many of those who showed them to me implicitly
or explicitly established comparisons between
this rapid increase and transformation in everything
Argentine, and the more deliberate advance of the
great nations of Europe, and deduced the conclusion
that Argentina was a more progressive and advanced
country.</p>

<p>The word “progress” is one of those which is much
misused in Europe. I had no sooner landed in Argentina,
however, than I recognised that the word had
quite a different sound and significance on that side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
of the water from what it has in Europe. The standard
by which my new transatlantic friends were unanimous
in measuring progress was the rapidity of transformation
and the magnitude of the results. New, modern,
larger, were to them synonyms of progress and of
improvement. Consequently, they had only to cast
their eyes round their own country to find reasons for
self-satisfaction. But this conception of progress at
first somewhat amused and somewhat irritated me,
just as the naïve touches of vanity in the young often
amuse and irritate grown men. Many a time, when
we were discussing the progress of Argentina and the
comparisons, tacit or explicit, which were made with
Europe, have I said to my Argentine friends:</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly the effort which you are making is a
noble one, and a paying one. In thirty years, you have
increased your wealth ten-, twenty-, even thirty-fold.
You have been wonderfully quick in extending cultivation,
railways, and population over the vast territory
which Fortune has given you. You are now flooding
the world with riches, and, profiting by the experience
of others, you can transform, reshape, and make perfect
your public services, your institutions, and your whole
mode of living in the smallest number of years.</p>

<p>“You make a great mistake, however, if you think
that the contrast between the rapidity of your growth
and your changes and the slowness and immutability
of Europe is any proof of your own nearer approach to
perfection. That rapidity is a phenomenon of youth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
A child’s weight and height double themselves every
six months, year, two years, or three years in the first
years of its life; while an adult stops growing or grows
so slowly as to be hardly aware that he is doing so.
Would you deduce from this that a boy of six years of
age is superior to a man of forty? No. Childhood and
manhood are two phases of life. Each has its own
necessity, its own function, its own advantages and
disadvantages. It is no more possible to compare them
than it is to compare day and night, dawn and twilight,
winter and summer; I can see no essential difference
between the countries of Europe and your own. We
are all children of the same civilisation; we have been
nursed at the same breast. We are all like one to the
other, though we may differ one from the other as
brothers, or, if you prefer it, as cousins do. So an
American progress, different from European progress,
does not exist, though there are countries whose
transformation, owing to external circumstances, may
be retarded or accelerated. You have political institutions
and social orders of less antiquity, and, therefore,
of less rigidity and less strength than those of Europe.
You also have a territory to exploit which is vaster,
very much vaster, and much more easy to exploit,
because civilisation supplies you, ready to hand, with
almost perfect instruments for such exploitation. There
you have the real difference between us.”</p>

<p>Though these arguments were listened to with
courteous attention, they made but a slight impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
on my hearers. I very soon realised that American progress,
the rapid increase, that is to say, of the wealth of
Argentina and the incessant modernisation of the customs
and institutions of the country, were a sort of
national religion, which was accepted by most people
with a blind credence. So in the end, I was persuaded
that this ardent faith in progress must be attributed
to the preponderating influence of Buenos Aires, that
immense city, almost half the population of which is
composed of European immigrants in search of wealth.
For it is the largest port, the principal emporium, and
the financial centre of the Republic, through which
passes most of the export and import trade, nearly all
the great stream of wealth which flows out from the
vast territory over the world, and from the world
ebbs back to it again: a rich American city, after the
European picture of such. It is only natural that a city
whose wealth and size are being multiplied by the
rapid development of the country should have adopted
American progress as its religion, and should, through
its influence, have imposed that religion on the whole
country. The conclusion of the matter was, however,
that the Argentine conception of progress was not and
could not be anything but the passing exaltation of a
fortunate country which, profiting by circumstances
unusually favourable, could watch its wealth growing
round it with bewildering rapidity. That, at any rate,
was the conclusion I came to, and I thought it both
reasonable and justifiable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>With this idea in my head, after a laborious, agreeable,
and instructive stay of two months in Argentina, I
sailed for Rio, making on my way thither a brief halt at
Montevideo. I expected to find in Rio another American
city like Buenos Aires. I was, however, mistaken.
Brazil is not, like Argentina, a single body with one
enormous head. Its economic activity is more diffuse
and centres in different cities,—for coffee, in São
Paulo; for rubber, in Manaos; for each one of the other
great articles of production, in other cities scattered
over the vast territory. Rio de Janeiro, though the
chief political and intellectual centre of the Confederation,
cannot, therefore, be called either the emporium
or the port, or the economic capital <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>.
Consequently, it differs widely from Buenos Aires. It
is less crowded, noisy, and busy. It lives, I might almost
say, in the shade of its gardens and between the
forest and the sea, quietly and reposedly. It is the
only great American city I have visited in which people
walk at a leisurely pace and not at headlong speed;
and it not only lives reposedly, but it thinks, and even
dreams a little.</p>

<p>While at Buenos Aires, we had lived surrounded by
men of action; we found at Rio a coterie composed
almost exclusively of intellectuals—literary men, journalists,
historians, philosophers, and jurists. Most of
them were state officials and members of the Brazilian
Academy,—an academy founded about ten years ago
and modelled exactly on the lines of the Académie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
Française,—composed, like it, of forty members, elected
in the same way, and admitted with the same ceremonial.
In a small inn situated on the slopes of Corcovado,
on the outskirts of the town and the forest, whose
roads were shaded by secular trees, we lived for six
weeks, just as Plato and his friends lived in the gardens
of the Academy; discussing art, literature, philosophy,
right, and morality with the friends whom Graça
Aranha, the diplomatist and man of letters chosen by
Baron di Rio Branco to do us the honours of Brazil,
gathered round us almost daily. At no moment of my
life have I felt myself so much detached from, and so
superior to, the accustomed preoccupations which form
the groundwork of ordinary existence in the modern
world. And when I found myself living amongst persons
for whom the culture of Europe represented the
supreme blessing of life, the greatest pride of civilisation,
for a moment I believed myself freed from that
demon of American progress which had dogged me in
Argentina.</p>

<p>It was an illusion, however, which did not last long.
Brazil is a country slightly older than Argentina.
Owing to this reason, to its much greater size, to the
variety of its climates and lands, which make it impossible
to concentrate in a single city the direction of
the whole of national life, and to other contingent
reasons which it would take too long to enumerate here,
Brazil has not developed in the last twenty years so
rapidly as has Argentina. It has, however, developed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
much more quickly than any European country. I
speedily saw that the rapidity of this progress was the
great national pride of the Brazilians, even of those
men of letters, philosophers, and writers, who professed
to be such devoted disciples and admirers of Europe.
In the same way the great national preoccupation was
the acceleration, as far as possible, of the progress and
increase of riches, and the exploiting and modernisation
of the country, so that Brazil might not appear inferior
in this particular to the other great states of America.
An energetic administration had just finished the resanitation
of Rio de Janeiro, destroying, at the cost of
vast public works, all the breeding-places of yellow
fever which up till then had infested it. The administration
was then renovating it from top to bottom,
opening streets and squares in the middle of the old
quarters, constructing spacious promenades and gardens,
and sumptuous public edifices, in a word, giving
air and light and splendour and beauty to a city which
was already beautiful in addition to being placed in
a unique situation. I think there must be very few
cities which in a few years have managed to destroy
and rebuild, according to new plans, so large a part of
themselves. Naturally the work has cost millions;
but on the few occasions on which I timidly dared to
make a remark to this effect, I received the laughing
answer: “We are optimists; and we believe in progress!”
This ædilitian transformation of Rio de Janeiro filled
with pride all Brazilians, including my lettered and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
philosophical friends, on account of its rapidity and
grandeur; and their pride was swelled by the thought
that no European states, but perhaps the United States
of North America alone, their great elder brother, could
have done so much.</p>

<p>Everybody thought, moreover, that the whole of
Brazil ought to be modernised just like Rio, from top
to bottom. I visited São Paulo, the great coffee-producing
state. I traversed from end to end Minas
Gerães, the great agricultural and mineral state which,
as a symbol, as it were, of its intention to modernise
itself entirely, has recently constructed a smiling and
graceful new capitol, Bello Horizonte, in a most picturesque
position crowning the hoary Ouro Preto.
Everywhere I found politicians, officials, professors,
literary men, commercial men, bankers, Brazilian and
European immigrants, united in the same thought:
that railways must be built, machinery bought, able
engineers engaged, mines explored, cultivation extended,
and industries founded to increase the
country’s rate of progress by modernising it entirely.
It was useless for me to try to prove even to those of
my Rio acquaintances who were endowed with the
highest and finest intellectual culture, that this
conception of progress was too simple and material;
that real progress is not to make new or to make
quickly, but to make better; that it is not enough
to augment wealth, but that it is necessary also
to put it to good use, a more difficult problem than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
the producing of it. I tried to convince my friends that
if so simple and material a notion of progress acquired
a strong hold on the popular mind, the public would
infallibly be impelled to create, not a lofty and noble
civilisation, but a sort of opulent barbarism. In Brazil,
as much as in Argentina, my arguments beat harmlessly
against a faith and a passion which demands no proofs.
“American Progress” for the Brazilians too was the
great historical force of the future, which is going to
create the new world, and the new civilisation whose
dim foreshadowing seems to be agitating the masses
at the present time.</p>

<p>We returned to Italy in November. I recrossed the
ocean from Rio de Janeiro to Genoa in fifteen days,
during which I reread my books of philosophy. But
the pages of Bergson, Kant, and Comte, which I read
in mid-ocean, no longer riveted my attention as they
had on the way out. For in the time for thought
afforded me by the crossing, far from the world and its
troubles, I plunged day by day in a more intense meditation
on American progress, which, of all the things
and phenomena I had witnessed, was that which had
left on me the liveliest impressions. It was clear that
it was not a theoretical idea, but a passion, a faith, a
religion fervently embraced by nearly everybody. All
the arguments which I had advanced to subject it to
criticism had been fruitless; and not only ignorant men,
and those eager to make money, but the most highly
cultivated minds, the very intellectual élite of America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
were blind to the contradictions and logical shortcomings
of this conception. Nevertheless, was not this
but an additional reason for studying this phenomenon
thoroughly? It is not ideas which move and transform
the world, but passions; and a passion, even if it be
absurd, is a thousand times more powerful than a wise
idea.</p>

<p>Now it was not difficult to see what would happen if
this religion of American progress spread through the
world. Europe would lose, so to speak, her rights of
historical primogeniture, and all her ancient civilisation
would lose a great part of its value. If the rapid
increase of riches is the supreme measure of civilisation,
and if, in consequence, the efforts of a people must
be concentrated on everything which can accelerate
this increase, it is clear that the most ancient, populous,
and glorious countries of Europe will not be able to
keep pace with the young countries and with the
nations which are masters of vast territories; and that,
bit by bit, the most glorious civilisations of Europe will
come to be regarded by the eyes of the rising generations
as relics and fossils of another age. This danger
no longer appeared to me so distant and hypothetical
as to many other Europeans. After what I had seen
in America, many facts and thoughts and tendencies
to which I had hitherto paid scarcely any attention in
Europe, seemed to me to acquire a new significance.
I saw everywhere, even in the ancient world, traces and
proofs of the rapid spread of the American idea of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
progress, especially among the nations like Germany,
which have developed industry to a great, perhaps a
too great, extent; and in all the countries, classes, and
professions which have identified their interests most
completely with those of industry. So the enemy who
threatened the destruction of the ancient civilisation of
Europe had already invaded the Old World.</p>

<p>It was while I was meditating on these thoughts in
mid-ocean that the idea occurred to me of writing
something different from a book of impressions on
Argentina and Brazil. Too many books of impressions
of the two Americas are written in Europe; and literature
of this sort, as copious as it is useless, has justly
satiated the public. Inasmuch as this idea of progress
implies a great conflict of tendencies, from which may
arise a profound upheaval of our civilisation, why
should I not contrast in a book the two conceptions of
progress, that which America has created and is trying
to impose on the world, and that which is even now
professed in Europe by the classes most faithful to
tradition, and which they ought to seek to defend? If
I succeeded in giving a vivid representation of this
conflict, should I not have described a living part of
America better than if I had merely accumulated
thousands of detached impressions and observations?
And so the idea flashed across my mind of writing a
dialogue introducing some Europeans and Americans
who on board a steamer in mid-ocean discussed Europe
and America, that is to say, progress, in the sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
proper to the word as well as in the sense given to it
by the Americans. Is not the dialogue an ancient and
glorious literary form? It is true that for many reasons
it has lately been neglected, one particular reason being,
that in modern life, busy and exhausting as it is, it is
difficult to find a scene which will give verisimilitude
to a conversation lasting several days. Modern civilisation
is a civilisation of much action and little discussion.
However, there is still one scene left in modern life on
which one can stage with artistic verisimilitude a discussion
lasting several days: a transatlantic liner. A
liner is perhaps the only spot in the modern world
where one may find discussion holding the field.
Usually discussions on board ship deal with frivolous
and empty topics. Why might not a writer suppose,
however, that for once in a way, four or five serious-minded
persons met on board a liner and began a
casual talk which later developed into a discussion
of one of the gravest of the problems which oppress
our own generation, no less than every one of its
predecessors?</p>

<p>Among the persons whose acquaintance I had made
during the voyage, some appeared to me to lend themselves
to the rôle of interlocutor in the dialogue. So,
directly I got back, I began to sketch out my dialogue.
It was then that I experienced a curious phenomenon.
With every fresh attempt I made to embody in certain
characteristic personages the American idea of progress,
as I had observed it in so many of my friends on that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
side, and the European idea, as I had many times
defended it, both ideas seemed to me to evaporate,
and to lose consistency and colour. That conflict of
tendencies, ideas, and passions which had seemed to me
so lively and so profound in my meditations in mid-ocean
appeared to have melted away after I had
touched the soil of old Europe. The dialogue which I
was writing seemed to me cold, dead, and academic.</p>

<p>I was torn in two directions by these difficulties, uncertain
whether to abandon the enterprise, and asking
myself whether American progress had not been a
passing hallucination of the voyage; when towards the
middle of February, 1908, I received from North
America a new surprise of a still greater and more
agreeable nature, in the shape of a letter from Baron
Eduardo Mayor de Planches, at that time Italian
Ambassador at Washington, in which he told me that
President Roosevelt at his last diplomatic reception
had expressed to him his wish to see me in the United
States, and to have me as his guest for a few days at
the White House before his presidential term ended.
At any time, so courteous an invitation from a man for
whose culture, intellect, and statesmanlike qualities I
had so great an admiration, would have given me much
pleasure. My joy was much increased, however, by
the fact of its having arrived two months after my
return from South America. A visit to the United
States directly after one to South America was a rare
stroke of luck. For, to tell the truth, in visiting Brazil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
and Argentina, I had seen only a fragment of the New
World. But to come to know that great New-World
State which by itself personifies America in the eyes of
all, and to come to know the two largest states of South
America into the bargain, was equivalent to saying
that I had studied at least what was most important,
characteristic, and deserving of study in the boundless
continent which Columbus discovered. All the curiosity
to which the rumours and legends current in
Europe about the United States had given birth in me,
and which was dominant in the recesses of my mind,
awoke to life. I forgot the problem of progress, the
doubts which tormented me, and the problems which
I had posed to myself on my travels in Argentina, as
well as the dialogue I intended to write, in my preparation
for my fresh journey and for the lectures in Roman
history which I was scheduled to give at the Lowell
Institute, at Columbia University, and at the University
of Chicago. I set to work to read as many books
as I could about North America. I resumed the mantle
of Roman historian to prepare my course of lectures
and gave no further thought to the book on America
which I had promised to write.</p>

<p>On November 1, 1908, I sailed for New York, and a
three months’ course of the intense life began again for
me; rapid journeys, incessant visits, interviews with
journalists, hundreds of conversations, banquets, receptions,
speeches, and inquiries. I visited schools, hospitals,
universities, prisons, law-courts, factories, banks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
and co-operative enterprises. I made the acquaintance
of millionaires and artisans, industrialists and professors,
lawyers and journalists. I managed to get a
peep into the wealthy abodes of the rich families of the
great cities of the East, and into the little houses in
which the middle classes drag out a crowded and
pinched existence. I witnessed the frenzy for work,
the incessant activity, the unending agitation which
wears out every class in America. Most important of
all, however, I saw reappear before me—and this time
in gigantic form, monstrous, unrestrained, almost sublime
in its savage energy—that demon of American
progress which had impressed me so much in Brazil
and Argentina, comparatively small though it had
there appeared to me, and which in Europe seemed to
me to have almost melted away. Was it not this which
imbued everything American with that startling air of
novelty, extravagance, and grandeur, which stunned
and almost frightened me? So I devoted myself not
only to the accumulation of impressions, informations,
and recollections in profusion; I also set to work in
the tumult of American life to think again about
American progress. I made an effort to dive deeper
down into the nature of this strange phenomenon, to
guard against its melting away from before me when I
got back to Europe. And at last, one day, I really
thought I had found the clue.</p>

<p>My wife and I had been invited to luncheon with a
cultured and clever author, who knew three languages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
had received an extensive and liberal education,
and lived by her pen, writing for newspapers, translating,
and giving lessons. She belonged, in fact, to what
one might call the intellectual middle class. She lived
with a sister in a street of old New York, occupying a
little flat of the kind in which many middle-class New
Yorkers live. One reached it by a little wooden staircase,
and entered it by a little door, opening on to a
little corridor, which gave access to four tiny rooms,
whose floors creaked under foot and whose walls let the
voices and noises of the neighbours and co-lodgers be
clearly heard. Outside the windows and extending to
the court-yard, the fire-escapes reminded one that the
house, partly constructed of wood, might at any moment
catch fire like a match. Naturally there were no
servants in the house. With her sister’s help the
charming author, when she returned home, laid
down the pen and became cook and chambermaid.
The luncheon, considered from an artistic point of
view, gave us clearly to understand, that the hands
which had prepared it did not possess any very considerable
technical skill. That did not prevent us,
however, from enjoying ourselves mightily, so interesting
and pleasant was the company.</p>

<p>Now, while I was eating my luncheon, and looking
round me, I thought that America must certainly be
much wealthier than the wealthiest of European countries.
A woman as richly endowed with intellect and
culture as my kind hostess, who lived by her pen in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
Paris, Rome, or London, would certainly earn less than
she. And yet the foreign woman could live in better
style, keep a servant to relieve her of the most troublesome
and humble of her domestic duties, live in a large
and less inflammable house, and have fresher and
better prepared food to eat. If she married a man of
her own station, she could more easily and with less
stint, bring into the world, rear, and educate a family.</p>

<p>From my hostess, I passed on to think of all the
other persons of the same station in life, of those
middle classes which are everywhere the support and
foundation of democratic institutions and the great
reserve of energy of modern civilisation. In New York,
Boston, and Philadelphia, the great cities of the East,
I had seen several families belonging to this class. I
had even been the recipient of their confidences and
complaints. At that moment, I realised clearly how
much more difficult and laborious, owing to the greater
cost of food and lodging, the extreme difficulty of finding
servants, and the enormous expense of rearing, and
still more of educating, children must be the life
of those middle classes in the great cities of the United
States than in the great cities of Europe. Like my
hostess, a business clerk, a humble employé, or an
artisan in the most select industries, though he gains less
in Paris or in London than in New York, can live much
better in the former towns. He can eat better, lodge
more comfortably, employ someone to help in the household,
and rear his family without excessive drudgery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>Then I asked myself: “But what is the use of wealth,
then, if it is not a means of living better, of securing
some extra ease, comfort, or pleasure? What is the
reason for this startling paradox, of riches turning
from a blessing into a torment? How comes it that
America, which has shown such energy in the exploitation
of the immense wealth hidden in her boundless
territory, has not followed up her conquests by converting
these riches to the benefit of the whole population?
How is it that, in this fortunate country, it is
these middle classes who suffer most who yet have an
influence on the Government such as they have in no
European country? Why can we find in poorer
countries individuals and classes who are happier
because they are better satisfied with their condition?”</p>

<p>It was by reflecting on this problem that I at last
arrived at a comprehension of the real nature of
American progress, and that I finally lighted on the
subject, the frame, and the key of the dialogue over
which I had so long worried. How and in what way, I
shall recount in the following chapter.</p>

<hr />

<div id="toclink_139" class="chapter">

<span class="subhead">FACTS AND MOTIVES IN THE MODERN WORLD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Like</span> every other European, I had gone to North
America with the fixed idea that it was the
country of the practical spirit <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>, and that
the Americans were all men who did not lose themselves
in dreams, but lived in reality, intent on shaping
it to their own ends, and acquiring by the most rapid
means the tangible and sure blessings of life—riches,
prosperity, power, and the mastery over nature. I
was convinced that they knew better than anyone else
the art of increasing the comforts, and diminishing the
difficulties, of life by the intelligent use of the means
furnished by nature, fortune, and preceding generations.
I expected, therefore, to find in America, many facts
and few ideas; an intelligent and vigorous egoism
omnipresent; scanty traces of idealism, and but little
faith in the transcendent principles which so often lead
dreamers—individuals and nations—to toil and fight
for fair but unreal chimeras, in the vain hope of distant
glory or grandeur.</p>

<p>So my first surprise, and a very great one it was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
arose from my examination at close quarters, of the
policy pursued by the United States in dealing with the
immense herds of immigrants, who yearly pour into
their harbours from all parts of the Old World. In
South America, I had closely observed the cautious
prudence and really practical sagacity with which the
republics try to prevent the continual immigration of
foreigners from disturbing too profoundly the political
balance of the State, by reserving the government to
small oligarchies born and educated in the country,
and therefore capable of directing public affairs with
a certain continuity of projects and of national spirit.
This policy of the South American republics is, I know,
severely criticised in Europe, and especially in Italy,
by too many persons who judge the affairs of the New
World by the standard of the ideas of the Old. But to
a historian of Rome, like myself, to whom history has
taught the great internal difficulties which were caused
in every ancient state by the μέτοιχοι or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">peregrini</i>,
this policy seemed practical and reasonable, at least
if it be granted that the principal task of every state
is that of solving in the best possible way the problems
of the hour and leaving to the future its own problems.</p>

<p>To grant every year citizenship in a new state to a
great number of men born and educated in distant
lands, who come stuffed with ideas and tendencies,
opinions which correspond in no wise with the utterly
different situation they find in the new country; to give
them political rights which they do not want or give a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
thought to; to make them, almost by force, the pillars
of a political constitution which they generally do not
understand; to hope to transform them in a flash from
subjects of ancient European monarchies into citizens
of young American republics—is not all this to do
violence to the practical ideas of government, and to
multiply the already great difficulties among which
every representative régime works, without any compensating
advantage, not even that of planting the
immigrants firmly in the new country? The vast
multitudes which are to-day crossing from Europe to
America no longer go, as they did once, in search of
liberty beyond the ocean. They go in search of higher
salaries, an easier and larger existence, and greater
probability of bettering themselves. To open to the
children of immigrants on the same terms as to home-born
children the high schools, the professions, and the
public offices—in short, all the roads by which the son
of a peasant or artisan can climb to the higher <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>—is
a surer means of planting firmly in the country
the crowds carried to America on the wave of emigration
than the concession to them of electoral rights.
And that is just what the states of South America,
with their practical spirit, have done and are doing.</p>

<p>With these impressions and opinions, I arrived from
South America in the America which symbolises in the
eyes of the world the practical spirit. And in this
America, to my no small surprise, I found the opposite
policy to this in actual operation, with all the effects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
which I imagined must follow it; in particular, the
growing difficulty of making democratic institutions
work smoothly, with an electoral body so swollen, so
enormous, and so varied and heterogeneous. I often
had occasion, when speaking or writing in the United
States, to remember that the cosmopolitan electoral
body which is the base of the democracy of the United
States recalls that of Rome, where the freedmen—the
immigrants of the time—became citizens, and were
inscribed in the electoral lists, whatever their national
origin, and even if they were all foreigners, barbarians
some of them, uncivilised the rest. Nevertheless, there
is between the United States and Ancient Rome one
essential difference; and that is, that in the Roman
Republic, the electoral operations were concentrated in
the capital, so that the number of persons who took part
in them, the really active electoral body, was extremely
small; while in the United States, the electors are
numbered by millions, and are scattered over a continent.
Do not most of the difficulties and inconveniences
of which I have heard America complain in
connection with its internal politics arise from the
enormous size of the electoral body and from its
heterogeneity? For both of these are unique phenomena
in the history of the world, as until now every
democracy has governed small, and often the tiniest
of, states. So this experiment, which America is making,
without being compelled to do so by any historical
necessity, is a new and bold one, the final result of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
which it is difficult to foretell. As a matter of fact,
the ancient national oligarchies, which governed North
America, for so many years after it had gained its
independence, did not open the doors of the constitution
to the immigrant multitudes who threatened, if
admitted, to swamp them. It would have been easy to
keep at least the first Europe-born generation out of
politics, because—as I have already said—the greater
number of immigrants arrive in America without the
vaguest idea, much less ambition, of obtaining what,
in a democracy, are the political rights of a citizen,
and only want big salaries.</p>

<p>How, then, has the United States come to this
pass? Certainly historical accidents have contributed
to set the Union in this direction. Historical accidents
would, however, not have sufficed, if they had not been
helped by that conception of democracy, not practical
but mystical, so to speak, which I have found obtains
among so many Americans. The rights of the people
are not in America a political doctrine, to be employed
by the nation and its governors in compassing certain
ends of general utility, and to be applied only in the
measure and with the limitations and qualifications
which make it fruitful of good results and prevent it
from giving rise to inconveniences. It is a transcendent
principle, an article of faith, as it were, to be applied
and developed without too much regard to the immediate
consequences, which must be endured with
patience if they are for the moment unpleasant or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
dangerous, in the conviction that the principle, being
just and true, must finally produce beneficial effects.</p>

<p>So, little by little, I was led to ask myself whether
by chance, in politics at any rate, the South Americans
and the Europeans were not more practical than the
North Americans, and whether the North Americans,
on the other hand, were not great idealists; at least, if
by the practical spirit is understood the art of solving
present difficulties by the quickest and simplest devices
with only an immediately realisable benefit in
view, instead of multiplying difficulties with future
benefits in view or for love of an idea or a principle.
The amazement and uncertainty caused by this preliminary
survey of the very foundations of the American
constitution were increased, however, by my
subsequent observation of the numberless philanthropic
works, educational institutions, intellectual, political,
or social foundations which owe their existence to the
inexhaustible generosity of the American upper classes.
For though Europeans may think that every American
thinks only of making money, a few weeks of travel
and of observation were enough to convince me that
America is quite as richly, perhaps more richly endowed
than Europe with wealthy men whose only
thought it is to spend their money for the good of their
fellows, for the progress of the nation, in a word, for
objects of public utility.</p>

<p>However, though American philanthropic works may
equal and often exceed those of Europe in number and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
in value, I have often had occasion to notice one
difference between those of the two continents: and
that is, that the American works are not unusually
inspired by a more intense, I might almost say a more
ingenuous faith in the power of man over the miseries
and difficulties of life. The American often addresses
himself with fervour, energy, and great intellectual and
pecuniary effort to the eradication of ills which the
European regards as incurable and irresponsive to
treatment. And this American faith in the power to
rectify, revive, and purify nature often struck me, no
less than many other Europeans, as fringing on the
chimerical. In short, even in what are called social
works, the American often seemed to me more idealist,
more of a dreamer, and less practical than the European;
more ready, that is to say, to venture on a struggle
against the innumerable ills of life without being quite
sure of possessing adequate means for conquering them,
at the summons of a mystical faith in the progress of
the world.</p>

<p>As the result of all my observations, I kept asking
myself whether by chance the United States, notwithstanding
their great practical activity, might not be a
much more mystical, idealistic, and visionary people
than the European gives them credit for. But I did
not dare answer the question with a resolute Yes or No.
I could not answer No, because that would have involved
ignoring facts which were daily obtruding themselves
on my notice. On the other hand, I dared not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
answer Yes, because I was afraid of being accused of
excessive fondness for paradoxes, and of wishing to do
violence to current opinions at every opportunity and
at all costs. So I went groping around for a truth
which so far I conjectured rather than saw.</p>

<p>I had reached this point in my reflections and observations
when I was invited to luncheon by our
friend the author and journalist whom I have mentioned
in the preceding chapter. When I saw her
home and mode of life, I could not help asking myself:
For what reason is the general standard of wealth
higher, while that of living is no higher, in America than
in Europe? Why are dwellings in the great American
cities so small, the distances so great, the communications
so difficult, provisions so dear, that notwithstanding
the vast riches of the country, life is for the
masses and the middle classes more expensive and
difficult than in many much less wealthy cities of
Europe? The primary answer was not difficult: Because
the cities have become too big and populous,
because their growth has been too rapid in comparison
with the progress of agriculture, and because a section
at least of their inhabitants has contracted too expensive
habits and is accustomed to a life of too great
luxury. This primary answer, however, gave rise to a
second question: Why have the cities grown so rapidly,
and with the cities the luxury of every class? This too
was easily explained: Because of the rapid development
of industries. America is a vast continent of great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
natural wealth, where capital accumulates rapidly.
Owing to her ability to accumulate capital readily, and
to find work for the numberless hands which the overcrowded
districts of Europe have been supplying for
the last hundred years to those American countries
which have need of them, America has been able, not
only to extend her agriculture rapidly and to exploit her
mines, but also, and in particular, to multiply her
industries to the point of packing her larger cities with
so dense a crowd of inhabitants that life has become
difficult for the majority of the town populations.</p>

<p>At this point, however, one conclusion seemed to
emerge from the preceding observations. Suppose
North America, instead of employing all the capital
at her disposal in her many industries, as well as the
capital borrowed from European countries poorer than
herself, had done as France is doing in Europe, namely,
had invested part of her capital in foreign countries, in
loans to governments, cities, railways, industries,
trades, and agricultural enterprises, what would have
happened? The demand for labour would doubtless
have been less in America, and therefore the emigration
to it would not have been so startling. Her industries
would have developed less, and her cities would not
have increased so rapidly. The United States would
now have a smaller population to support, and one
better distributed between the cities and the country;
would have fewer cities, and those smaller. The band
of fortunates who have made huge wealth out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
rapid and prodigious development of the cities would
be smaller, but the middle and lower classes would
enjoy a more comfortable and easier existence. Their
condition would resemble much more closely that of
the middle and lower classes in Europe. They would
earn lower wages, but those wages, though numerically
less, would procure them greater comforts and pleasures.</p>

<p>It was now that, after my many discussions with
others, and my extended solitary meditation on the
difficult problem, I thought that I had finally confuted
the troublesome doctrine of American progress. What
is that progress of which the Americans are so proud
but the unbridled rush of enterprise which has so
rapidly multiplied the industries, enlarged the cities,
and increased the population and wealth of the United
States? But in that case it was clear that American
progress contradicted itself. By inciting the American
people to gather together capital and workers, to open
their gates to millions of European emigrants, to invest
their gains in new enterprises or in the enlargement of
old enterprises, to redouble and multiply in every
direction efforts and enterprises, so as to form of them
a mountain with which to scale the heavens, the spirit
of progress had created in America an opulence which
teemed with difficulties, contradictions, and embarrassments,
and which meant for a large part of the population
a condition somewhat resembling that of King
Midas: seeing riches all round him, and not being able
to enjoy them. But to produce riches with no prospect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
of enjoying them is an absurdity. Much wiser, therefore,
was old Europe, which, taught by the experience
of centuries, refused to let herself be dazzled by this
idea of progress, and instead of heaping up riches at
top speed as does the New World, was more careful in
her choice of new riches to create so that she might
enjoy them; so that she might make of them a fount
of well-being, not a cause of difficulty for mankind.</p>

<p>This was the moment at which I was inclined to
think that all the ideas of America and the optimistic
spirit which animates them, beginning with the idea of
progress, could only be a passing ebullition and the
merry madness of youth. This nation, I said to myself,
favoured as it is at the moment by unusual facilities
for the creation of wealth, has been so much carried
away by its success as to make of riches, which are and
can be only a means, an end in themselves. A longer
experience of history will convince America of its
mistake. One day, however, as I was again pondering
intently over the facts I had observed, which seemed
to prove that the Americans were often dreamers,
idealists, almost mystics in matters in which the Europeans
show themselves eminently practical, an idea
flashed across my mind. What if American progress,
which to me had seemed up to then to be but a youthful
madness, should prove, if thoroughly analysed, to be
only an idealistic and semi-mystical conception of
wealth itself? What if this nation, accused of desiring
only the immediate possession of worldly goods, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
wearing itself out in an unbridled and diabolical activity
from dawn till sundown, not with the object of
increasing its happiness and pleasure, but for a distant
end, transcending the egoism and even the consciousness
of the individual? What if all, without knowing it,
or impelled as it were by a superior, if not directly
mystical force, were labouring and even suffering for
this end—a new end, to which history can show us no
parallel; the conquest of an immense continent from
one sea to the other, by means of a new instrument
unknown to our forefathers: steam- or electricity-driven
machinery?</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>From progress, from the democratic and philanthropic
ideality of the Americans, from the economic
difficulties with which our kind hostess had to wrestle,
to machinery and to the conquest of the great territory
of the United States, may seem a risky, violent, and
unexpected transition or transitions. As a matter of
fact, I could not have executed so bold a transition
unaided. I was helped by my wife, in an indirect, but,
for that very reason, strange and decisive way. In
fact, without her help I should not have succeeded in
finding my bearings in the chaos of my American experiences,
nor in understanding how and to what extent
the Old World and the New World are opposed to each
other; as a result, I could not have written the philosophical
dialogue on Europe and America, which will
be published shortly. It seems to me necessary, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
to recount how this help was given me; and I hope that
my brief account will not be read without interest.</p>

<p>Several years before we embarked on our journeys
to the two Americas, my wife had begun a long and
deep study of modern machinery and of the great
mechanical industry. Though a daughter of Cesare
Lombroso, who was a great inventor, she is temperamentally
inclined to the ancient more than to the new,
and therefore little disposed by nature to admire the
gigantic disorder of modern society which other minds
find so intoxicating. Her innate antipathy to the
civilisation of steam and electricity had been increased
a thousandfold by observation of the profound
perturbation which the great mechanical industry has
caused in a country of ancient civilisation like Italy,
densely populated and living on the resources of a
small territory devoid of great natural riches. But
when she at last made of machinery an object of
methodical study, her researches and the evidence she
had patiently accumulated transformed this antipathy
into a complex and bold theory, the cardinal idea of
which I think I can express as follows. Machinery
produces only apparent wealth and prosperity, because
instead of diminishing the effort necessary to
produce the things we need, and therefore their price,
in reality it increases it. The mechanical industry
demands immense capital to construct the machines
and set them going; immense quantities of raw material
to keep the machinery always busy; the concentration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
of the industry in places where combustibles or the
motive forces abound; consequently an enormous development
in the means of communication, for the
exchange of products and raw materials, and a dense
population accustomed to produce and consume as
much as possible. Therefore, the civilisation of steam- or
electricity-driven machines cannot develop without
rapidly exhausting nature, so to speak—mines, or
forests, or the fertility of the soil. That explains why it
flourishes chiefly in vast and naturally wealthy territories,
which it rapidly exploits and impoverishes.
Indeed, it explains why it is always seeking for new,
rich territories, seeking to penetrate unexplored continents,
like Africa, as soon as it has conquered America.
Nor is it difficult to understand why nations which live
in countries of limited natural resources get more harm
than good, and often become involved in vexatious
crises, from the introduction of mechanical civilisation.
It is clear, too, how that civilisation must result in
making life ever more and more expensive, and therefore
forcing men to despoil the earth and to work ever
harder, without ever attaining to satisfaction.</p>

<p>These ideas were the subject of long and lively discussions
between my wife, her father, and myself.
These discussions, as was natural with discussions arising
out of a doctrine which was maturing in the mind of a
patient seeker after truth, were, so to speak, eccentric;
they revolved now round one point, now round another.
Nevertheless, the central point round which they ultimately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
revolved was this: whether the wealth for which
man has to thank machinery is real or apparent. I
said that, since machinery produces much and at great
speed, there seemed to me no room for doubt that it
increased the sum of benefits at man’s disposal, and
therefore enriched the world. My wife replied that if
machinery produces much, it also consumes enormously,
more indeed than it produces, so that a mechanical
civilisation must always feel itself tormented by the
necessity of having more than it possesses, and, therefore,
must be always in a state of indigence. So the
discussions went on, lively and long, without either
of the parties convincing the other; and at last I came
to the conclusion that our <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i> must be making
us persist in the sophistical discussion of an unreal
question.</p>

<p>When I got to America, however, I saw that the
question we were discussing was anything but unreal;
for it was these ideas and discussions which enabled me
to collate our friend’s economic difficulties with the
mystical spirit which pervades so large a part of
American life, and to understand the nature of American
progress. Were not the economic difficulties encountered
especially in the big cities, notwithstanding
the immense wealth of the country, by the most
numerous classes of America, the decisive proof that
really, as my wife asserted, the wealth created by a
mechanical civilisation is to some extent only apparent?
That notwithstanding the great depredation of nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
carried out with means furnished by science, men’s
needs increase faster than their riches; therefore that
mechanical civilisation revolves in the vicious circle
of an insoluble contradiction? All the same, if America
had set herself with less eagerness to exploit by means
of machinery her immense natural resources; if she had
not welcomed so many millions of men from all parts
of the world; if she had not invested in machinery and
industries and railways such a vast amount of capital,
without a doubt we should find a smaller number of
people living, and living more comfortably, in America
to-day; but the conquest of the vast continent would
not have reached its present pitch, and the world
would not have witnessed that unparalleled event in its
history, the bewildering development of the United
States.</p>

<p>In fact, we must not forget, if we wish to realise what
a miracle the civilisation of machinery has succeeded
in accomplishing in the New World, how slow and
difficult was the expansion of mankind over the world
up to the end of the eighteenth century, that is,
during a period when men worked with their hands and
travelled over their planet on their own legs, or on
those of animals little swifter than themselves. The
great plains acted as so many great barriers in the
way of men’s occupation of the land, because men lost
their way in them. Consequently men tended to
settle on little tracts of land, in such a way as to be
near one another, to be able to communicate easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
with one another, and to exchange their products.
Everybody knows how slow has been in Europe the
advance of civilisation from south to north; how many
centuries were required for the passage of the Alps and
expansion into Gaul, how many for the crossing of the
Rhine and extension as far as the Elbe, and again for
the passage of the Elbe and the advance towards the
Vistula and the great plains of Eastern Europe. In
America itself—in the South as well as in the North—up
to the end of the eighteenth century, the progress of
population and civilisation was very slow and difficult.</p>

<p>In the twentieth century, on the other hand, a
prodigy occurred, thanks to steam-engines and all the
other machines of which the steam-engine is the parent.
With these machines, men can exploit more rapidly and
thoroughly all the wealth of the earth, and with the railways
can export the wealth produced, even from the most
remote and buried regions, which thus can be peopled
and exploited. Civilisation, following the railway-lines,
and armed with fire and machines, in little more than
fifty years extended from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
crossing and occupying, however summarily, the immense
territories of the interior, and binding together
with a network of communications and interests,
cities, climates, and territories without number from
east to west, from north to south. But machinery is
an inanimate instrument, only to be imbued with
creative force by the thought and will of man. In
consequence, this miracle of history would not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
come about if a bold and energetic people had not
multiplied machines with extraordinary rapidity over
the whole immensity of their territory; if they had not
subordinated to this supreme end every other good,
æsthetic beauty, the preservation of traditions, the
purity of the national spirit, and even the conveniences
of life which wealth can give. American progress is
then a transcendent and mystical idea which inflames
America with passion and impels it to accomplish the
new and rapid conquest of its own territory. And logic
wastes its time looking for and laying bare contradictions
in it savouring of the absurd. Doubtless, to work
with frenzied zeal at creating riches in order to be
unable to enjoy them is an absurdity if judged in the
light of the interest of each individual; but are not all
ideals absurd, when judged in the light of the interest of
the individual? What does it matter to the soldier who
dies in battle that his country emerges victorious from
the conflict in which it is engaged, seeing that he will
not be able to enjoy the fruits of the victory? From the
point of view of personal interest, it is better to live in
a country disgraced and diminished by a defeat than
to die in a country aggrandised by a victory. So the
privations to which I had seen exposed in the intimacy
of her home, that kind hostess of ours, who had offered
us luncheon in her modest flat, no longer seemed an
absurd contradiction of life. Her privations were
transfigured into a small personal sacrifice necessary for
the fulfilment of a great national work, transcending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
the interest and the wishes of every individual
American.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Thus at last I had grasped American progress and its
apparent incongruities. It was an ideal of life, born and
rapidly matured in a new continent during the past
half century, at a time when the conquest of the vast
territory by means of machinery was becoming more
widespread and more intense. It was the ideal of life
which, overshadowing all the others, had called forth
from the depths of American society the marvellous
energy which has staggered the world. When I had
once found the key to this enigma, many phenomena
of American life seemed to me clearer. I could easily
explain to myself why the public attached less weight
to politics on that side than in Europe, and regarded the
defects and shortcomings in its political institutions with
an indifference which to Europeans seems strange; in
particular, why it preferred having them in a condition
full of defects and inconveniences rather than any reform
which increased the power of the State and limited the
initiative of the individual. I could explain also how it
had succeeded in keeping alive that spirit of liberty,
not in politics only, but in religion, administration,
customs, and culture which often strikes Europeans as
either excessive or bizarre. The great national work—the
conquest of the continent—is accomplished much
more by personal initiative than with the help and
under the direction of the State; the important point,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
therefore, is that personal energy should be subjected
in this great work to the smallest possible number of
limits and restrictions.</p>

<p>Lastly, I could explain why in American society, to
borrow a rather quaint philosophical expression, the
category of quantity prevails over that of quality.
During my first few weeks in America, I used to smile
when I heard some Americans go into ecstasies at the
thought that everything in America was big, from the
country to the cities, the factories, and the statistics of
population; when they gloated over comparisons between
their own country and the little countries of
Europe, and statements of the comparative superiority
in size of things in their own country. I no longer
smiled, however, when I realised what American progress
represented. A civilisation, whose principal instrument
for the accomplishment of its work and for
establishing itself in the world is machinery, must
necessarily consider the quantitative criterion the supreme
criterion of perfection. In what respect, indeed,
is machinery, regarded as an instrument of production,
superior to the human hand? Everybody knows that its
superiority consists not in quality, but in the quantity,
of its output. Machinery produces much and quickly.
The hand produces little and slowly. The hand, however,
can attain a standard of perfection which is
denied machinery. Man will never succeed in constructing
a machine capable of sculpturing the Venus
of Milo or of weaving the marvellous tapestries which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
we admire in the museums of Europe. Everything of a
high degree of perfection is exclusively handmade;
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versa</i>, the hand, however, it may strive and labour
and practise, will never succeed in attaining in its work
the giddy rapidity of which steam- and electricity-driven
machines are capable, or in producing in so short
a time so many good things. Consequently, in a
civilisation in which machinery predominates, men will
be continually making fresh efforts to live faster and
faster, and to produce and consume more and more
rapidly. They will not be, on the other hand, too
exacting on the score of quality. They will be content
with things which look nice, without demanding extraordinary
excellence or finish in details. They will be
better pleased to consume many examples of products
of inferior durability than one single example of products
of great perfection. Consequently, vagaries of
taste, continual movement, ready forgetfulness of traditions,
and abundance of mediocrity, will be salient
characteristics of machine-ruled civilisation. The great
works of art which were the glory of past régimes
will disappear for the present, which will see them
replaced by objects of medium quality offered in greater
quantity.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I found all these characteristics
in North America, and they no longer offended me.
They seemed to me necessary qualities of a society
which sets out to conquer a boundless territory with
machinery. Nevertheless, at this point, having solved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
the American problem, I was confronted with the
European problem under a new aspect. If American
progress, if machinery, if the quantitative criterion of
perfection are necessary weapons for the accomplishment
of the great historical work to which the United
States have set themselves, how are we to explain the
fact that in the states of Europe also machines are
being multiplied, the American idea of progress is
spreading, and the quantitative criterion of perfection
is prevailing gradually? All of them except Russia,
which in many respects resembles the United States,
are countries of an old civilisation, live in small tracts
of territory, and have not immense continents to exploit.</p>

<p>At this point I saw hovering over Europe and America
a new, vaster, and more general problem, which dominates
the two worlds and bestrides the Atlantic like a
great bridge: the struggle between quantity and quality.</p>

<span class="subhead">MORE OR BETTER?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is an undoubted fact that Europe is becoming
Americanised; that the American idea of progress—understood
to mean the increase of wealth and the
perfectioning of the instruments of production—is penetrating
European society. No profound knowledge of
European society is needed to recognise this. I would
even go so far as to say that the only idea which in the
last fifty years has sunk deep into the minds of the
masses in Europe is this American idea of progress.
I must, however, also confess that before I went to
America I belonged to that group of Europeans,
numerous enough, especially among the cultured and
upper classes, which laments this “Americanisation”
of Europe, and considers it to be a sort of mental
aberration and decadence on the part of the Old World.
The idea is fairly wide-spread in Europe. It may
startle a good many Americans; but it will not seem
paradoxical to those who spare a moment’s reflection
for the history of European civilisation up to the
French Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that, considered from the point of
view of our ancient history, this idea of progress, interpreted
American-fashion, is a kind of revolutionary
dissolving force. Perhaps the upheaval which it has
produced and is producing in Europe can almost be
compared with that which Christianity caused in the
ancient civilisation, when it destroyed in the Greco-Latin
world the political and military spirit which had
been the mainstay of that world. Indeed, we must not
forget that from the dawn of history up to the French
Revolution succeeding generations had lived in Europe
contented with little, faithful to traditions, and holding
every innovation to be a danger and every enterprise
a revolt against God and against the memory of their
ancestors. It is true that even in those days men
usually preferred ease to poverty and were not insensible
to the magnetism of gold. Even then, each succeeding
generation saw an increase in the wealth of the
world and in the spread of population over the face of
the earth. But how slow and spasmodic was the increase!
Up to the time of the French Revolution it is
impossible to discern in history any differences in wealth
and population at intervals of less than a century. The
change produced by each generation was so small as to
be barely recognisable. In compensation, the men of
that time strove to make the world fairer and better.
Art and religion were their absorbing preoccupation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From Greece [says one of the characters in my dialogue],
which taught the world to write and to sculp, up to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
Middle Ages which built the fairest cathedrals and the
most fantastic palaces of all times; from the Egypt of
the Ptolemies, from which the last rays of Hellenic beauty
illumined the Mediterranean world, up to the Rome of the
popes and up to the Venice of the sixteenth century, which
flaunted her marble pomp in the eyes of the world, up to
the France of the eighteenth century, which immortalised
her three sovereigns in three world-compelling decorative
styles; from Augustus, who protected Horace and Virgil,
up to Louis XIV, who protected Racine and Molière, and
up to the Marquise de Pompadour, who strove to make
Paris the metropolis of elegance,—was not the perpetuation
of a form of beauty the supreme ambition of every nation
and of every state? Consider the countless efforts made to
establish in the world the reign either of sanctity or of
justice or both, from the Roman Empire which created
law, up to Christianity which strove to cleanse human
nature of sin, and up to the French Revolution, which
proclaimed to the world the age of liberty, fraternity, and
equality.</p>
</div>

<p>Such was that old Europe which created the numberless
masterpieces of architecture, sculpture, and
painting, now so much admired by the Americans;
that old Europe which discovered America, created
science, and produced the French Revolution.
But what remains of that old Europe? American
progress is busy to-day destroying it; in particular,
the artistic spirit is rapidly disappearing from the continent
which for centuries was the world’s teacher of
beauty.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Do you seriously believe [asks another of my characters,
he who in the dialogue defends America and the new ideals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
of life] that it is any use nowadays lamenting the fact
that some rare genius is unable at the present day to give
birth to his immortal masterpiece in the solitude of his
pride? At a time when man is inventing increasingly
powerful machinery, and is conquering the earth, the sea,
the air, the vast treasures hidden in every nook and cranny
of the universe; with these marvellous tools in his hand is
recognising that he is becoming the wizard visioned in
the legends of centuries; while the masses are clamouring
for bread, victuals, education, ease, security, pleasures,
air, light, liberty, all God’s blessings in prodigious and
yearly-increasing quantities?</p>
</div>

<p>These words are not the vapourings of a fanciful
individual. They are repeated a hundred times daily
in Europe, in a more or less elegant form, for they
express the kernel of the thought of the Europe which
is being Americanised. I could quote many examples
in support of my contention. I will quote one only, a
characteristic one. A foreigner may often see in the
smaller Italian cities ancient monuments—churches or
palaces—which are gradually falling into ruin. The
nonchalance of the authorities or the ignorance and
stinginess of the proprietors suffer time to do its deadly
work, or even help to accelerate it by befouling the last
relics of a past beauty. The foreigner shakes his head,
sighs, mutters harsh judgments, and asks himself <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sotto
voce</i> whether the inhabitants of that little town are
barbarians. His stupor would be increased, however,
if he could speak with one of the locals and open his
mind freely to him. “We barbarians?”—would answer
the local shop-keeper, lawyer, doctor, or artisan. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
prove to the foreigner how wrong he was, they would
tell him that that little town has actually got electric
light! The municipality, which cannot find a few
thousand francs for keeping this or that great monument
in a decent state, will spend large sums on lighting
with electric light streets in which after 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> there
is nobody to be seen. The adoption of electric light
is an act of progress, and nowadays even the shop-keeper
and the artisan understand progress in this
American sense; while, with the exception of a few
cultured and art-loving persons, who have no influence
whatever, nobody ever thinks it a barbarism to allow
an old monument built by our fathers to fall into
ruin.</p>

<p>This is a trifling instance; but it indicates the new
spirit which is now pervading and conquering the
whole of Europe. The most evident proof of this
triumph of American progress is the decadence or disappearance
of all the schools of art. Europe was in
past centuries, in harder and more difficult times than
the present, the glorious mother and mistress of civilisation,
because under diverse forms, she managed to
create and keep going schools of literature, sculpture,
painting, architecture, and music. To-day, these schools
have almost all disappeared; and the few survivors,
with very few exceptions, are in a state of decadence.
On the other hand, schools of electricity, dyeing, weaving,
mechanics, commerce, and chemistry abound and
flourish; they are the only schools the masses now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
require. In past centuries, the states and aristocracies
of Europe had in various ways protected and encouraged
the arts; and this protection had been one of the
principal reasons for their progress. Now this is no
longer the case. The wealthy classes of Europe to-day
consider it much more dignified and elegant to build
motor-cars and aeroplanes than to help painting and
sculpture. As to the states, if one of them tries to
encourage some art, protests pour in from every side
that the expenditure is a wasting of the people’s money
in the most idiotic way. Italy was for centuries the
mistress of the world in every art. Yet even in Italy
bitter complaints are made to-day about the few
millions which the public bodies have spent in the last
thirty years in raising monuments to the great men of
the Revolution. On the other hand, how can sculpture
flourish, if nobody will pay the sculptors for the works
which they are capable of executing? And for what
reason is the State, which possesses ancient monuments,
unable to spend another million or two on keeping
alive the tradition of an art which has shed no little
glory on the Nation? Is not this tradition, too, a
national heirloom? But the first-born daughter of
Beauty no longer understands these simple truths.
Infected by the spirit of American progress, she
protests that the money spent on art is wasted;
she is right willing that hundreds of millions be
spent on the encouragement of the mechanical and
iron industries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>There is no need to wonder, therefore, if many Europeans
regret the Americanisation of the old continent
as a kind of grievous madness. Europe—especially its
upper classes—lives a great deal—it could hardly
help living—in its past history. I have already said,
that I, too, when I undertook my journeys to America,
was more or less of this same cast of thought. But in
America, confronted with this frenzy of desires and of
works which has attracted from all parts of the world
and fused into one people so many millions of souls, has
created so many cities and produced so much wealth,
it was no longer possible for me to shut my eyes to the
fact that so vast and profound a phenomenon must
depend on causes much more complex and grave than
a simple mistake or mental aberration. For what reason
was Europe ready to destroy even her secular tradition
of art for the sake of emulating that rapidity of execution
and audacity of enterprise which I was then
witnessing in the New World? This was the problem
which presented itself to me, after I had grasped the
meaning of American progress; and which I succeeded
in solving with the help of my wife’s investigations into
the history of machinery.</p>

<p>“Christopher Columbus,” says one of my characters,
in <i>Between the Old World and the New</i>, “not only discovered
America, but re-endowed man with the globe
which God had already given him, inasmuch as he
enabled man at last to know it.” Europe had remained
content up to the fifteenth century to live in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
little territory, ignorant of how great the world was.
That earlier limitation, however, only increased the
force of the impulse, given to man by the discovery of
America, to scour and ransack the oceans, with the
object of discovering and possessing the whole plane.
Between the sixteenth and the eighteenth centuries,
then, Europe saw the world expanding around her.
With the expansion of the world, however, came an
increase in the longing to possess it, to master it, and to
exploit it. How was Europe to do so, with means so
scanty, and under the sway of the ancient ideas, which
said to man, “Dare not!” which taught him to change
as little as possible the order of things under which he
had grown up, and not to yield to the temptation of
over-ardent desires and of over-lofty ambitions?</p>

<p>Then began, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
that effort of thought and of will which, slowly
at first, was destined gradually to arm our civilisation
with all the weapons necessary for the conquest and
exploitation of the earth. The sciences began their
advances. The first machines were invented and
applied. The idea of liberty of progress, of the rights
of man, and of the popular will began to undermine the
ancient beliefs and traditions. Nevertheless, it is probable
that these would have long resisted, and that the
ancient ties which restrained the human will from the
great enterprises would have slackened, but not broken
for who knows how many more centuries, if it had not
been for that immense event which convulsed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
history of Europe and America, the French Revolution.
The French Revolution and the great wars to which it
gave rise made such and so great breaches in the
ancient prison-walls of traditions and principles in
which our civilisation was confined that man could
thereafter easily escape through them and wander
freely over the vast world.</p>

<p>In fact, after the French Revolution, we see the
beginning of a new history of the world. The ideas of
liberty and of progress invade Europe and America.
In every class and in every nation comes an awakening
of new desires for comfort and culture. Industry develops,
railways spread, inventions multiply. Cities
become thronged and increase rapidly. The great new
phenomenon of the history of the world, the intensive
exploitation of America, begins. The new wealth,
especially that produced in such abundance in America,
whets men’s appetites. Gradually the desire for comfort,
ease, and culture spreads to multitudes more
numerous and to new nations, drives followers along
in the steps of pioneers, in turn prompts others to
follow them, and brings crowding on the heels of riches
already realised, the hungry greed of the masses; in a
word, impels all Europe and all America to the conquest
of the earth.</p>

<p>In consequence, not only America, but also Europe,
saw the beginning fifty years ago of what might be
truly called the Golden Age of human history, the epoch
of abundance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What has man dreamt of [exclaims one of my characters]—what
has man dreamt of, since the dawn of time, but the
Terrestrial Paradise, the Promised Land, the Garden of the
Hesperides, the Age of Gold, Arabia Félix; one single thing,
under various names, the empire of nature and abundance?
Is not the great myth which centuries have mildly fantasied
now at last materialising under our eyes?</p>
</div>

<p>But every medal has its reverse side; and we have
had to pay, and to pay dearly, for this fabulous abundance
which man had vainly visioned for centuries.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The modern world [says another of my characters]
has crowned quantity at the expense of quality—which is,
after all, an eternal law. For I can make in a certain time
things of a certain quality, that is to say, resembling a
certain model of perfection which I have before my eyes or
in my mind. But in that case, I cannot make any quantity
of it which I may require. I must rest content with that
quantity which I can manage, working with all my zeal.
I can say, on the other hand: I want so many things of a
certain quality. But in that case, I can no longer prescribe
the time necessary to finish them as my fancy bids me. Or
again: I wish in so much time to make such a quantity.
Very well; but in that case, I must put up with the best
quality I can get. So that whoever wants to increase the
quantity, and to curtail the time must abate his demand
for quality. And that is just what we are doing to-day
in this civilisation of ours, in which quantity reigns
supreme.</p>
</div>

<p>In the light of this idea that decadence in art, and in
so many other refinements of life, which many Europeans
impute to America, seemed to me no longer the
effect of an aberration on the part of the masses, but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
sort of compensation. We pay, and we ought to pay,
for the rapid fortunes so commonly made nowadays.
We pay, we ought to pay, for the speed of the trains,
the motor-cars, the aeroplane, the telegraph; and the
price is the mediocrity which pervades everything. We
cannot have, we must not want, everything in this
world,—railways as well as beautiful pictures, aeroplanes
as well as the marvellous furniture which the
great French artists used to make in the eighteenth
century, speed as well as good manners. For among
the reproaches hurled at America by Europe is that of
having banished from Europe by the example of her
democracy the good manners of our ancient ceremonial,
and substituted for it a rather over-simple and over-casual
cordiality. But can we expect the polished form,
for which the eighteenth century was famous, to survive
in the social relations of a civilisation which, like
ours, is always in a hurry? Among men, who live
between the train, the motor-car, and the telephone?</p>

<p>Every epoch directs all its efforts towards a supreme
goal, which for it is the all-important one. There have
been epochs ablaze with religious fervour, whose chief
aspiration it was to diffuse and to defend the faith.
There have been epochs with a profound sense of the
ambition for glory, which fought great wars. Others
again have turned their attention to the fostering of the
arts and sciences. Our civilisation aims, in the first
place, at the mastery over nature, and the intensive
exploitation of all the riches of the earth. We enjoy the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
advantages of it. We are not inclined to abjure railways
and telegraphs. We have no wish again to run
the risk of famine, which was such an ever-present one
to the civilisations of the past. We enjoy the incredible
abundance and liberty of the day and are by no means
eager to return to the pristine régime of discipline and
parsimony. We Europeans also, then, must resign
ourselves to paying the price which all these advantages
cost, and to living in an epoch in which art cannot
flourish in any high degree, in which religion will no
longer have the strength to emanate waves of mystical
ardour, and even science will be cultivated only so far
as it can be of immediate service to practical ends, by
intensifying and making more prolific the exploitation
of natural riches. For this, too, is a phenomenon
noticeable to-day in every part of Europe: disinterested
studies are falling into disfavour. Rich as it is, the
world of to-day is less capable of searching after the
true for the sole pleasure of expanding the field of
knowledge, than it was two centuries ago, when it was
so much poorer. Even scientists nowadays want to
see their discoveries turned into money.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The Americanisation of Europe, then, is a fatal
phenomenon. Europe, from the moment when she
aspired to great wealth and to the dominion of nature,
was called upon to renounce her claim to many of the
treasures of her ancient and refined culture. This was
the conclusion at which I rested for a moment. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
yet at this point, I, as a European, felt a misgiving.
If matters stood thus, was not Europe fatally doomed
to become even more thoroughly Americanised in the
future? At the present time, the appetites and ambitions
of all classes in Europe, even the most numerous,
have been given free rein. Everybody, from the aristocrat
of ancient lineage to the most obscure peasant,
wishes to earn, spend, and accumulate as much as he
can. There is no power, human or divine, which can
pretend to drive back towards its historical fountainhead
this immense torrent of greed and ambition.
Europe, thus, is fated to become increasingly oblivious
of the traditions of its ancient and disinterested culture;
to struggle to imitate and compete with America in the
production of great riches at greater speed. And, as
America with her immense territories and smaller store
of traditions is better equipped for the competition, so
Europe must necessarily become ever more and more
decadent in the future. The continent destined to
dominate the civilisation of the future, as Europe
dominated it up to the middle of the nineteenth century,
will be America.</p>

<p>There are not wanting persons in Europe who take a
delight in repeating from time to time this prophecy,
which to the ears of a European sounds somewhat
lugubrious. For a moment, when in America, I, too,
somewhat discouraged by the vitality of which the
American spirit of progress gives proof, felt myself
inclined to give ear to these prophets, whom hitherto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
in Europe I had always contradicted. Yes, culture in
Europe was destined to become ever more decadent
before the invasion of progress interpreted in the
American sense; quantity, that is to say, the nations
with vast territories at their disposal and capable of
rapidly producing vast wealth, would rule supreme in
the future, while the forces of idealism would lose a
great part of their ancient empire over the world.</p>

<p>America, however, actually America, proved to me
that the ancient culture represented by Europe is not
destined to die out, and that, if Europe is being Americanised,
America in compensation is being induced by
an eternal impulse to Europeanise herself! I, like so
many other Europeans, had gone to America, persuaded
that the American’s only thought is to make
money. But in America, I, too, ended with the conviction
that no country in Europe expends so much money,
labour, and zeal on founding museums, schools, universities,
and new religions; on fostering, in the midst of
the mechanical civilisation and the realm of quantity,
the arts, the religious spirit, and the disinterested
sciences; on preventing the loss of that intellectual
legacy of the past, in which Europe takes an ever-decreasing
interest, occupied as she is in developing her
industries and her trade. If, out of deference to history,
rather than to the present day, we may grant that
Europe represents in the world’s history the effort
directed to the perfecting of a lofty culture, artistic,
scientific, religious, or philosophic,—there is no doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
but that America is to-day becoming Europeanised;
is seeking, that is to say, to employ the vast riches
which she has accumulated by the intensive exploitation
of her territory in the promotion of the progress of
art, knowledge, and the religious spirit. Doubtless, not
all the efforts she makes are successful; but they are
numerous, intense, and obstinate. Indeed, if America
is open to any reproach in this relation, it is, in my
opinion, to that of feeling too ardent an admiration
for lofty culture—art and science in particular—an
admiration which sometimes blunts the critical sense,
and does not permit her to distinguish what in the
world of the ideal is authentic from what is counterfeit,
the real gold from pinchbeck. In fact, one can find in
no European country so lively and profound a trust in
science as in America. Europe knows that science can
do a great deal and has done a great deal, but that it
often promises, or raises hopes of, more than it can do.
Not so in America. Among the cultured, as among the
lower classes, faith in the power of science is practically
unlimited. There is no marvel which the American
does not expect to see issuing from the scientist’s closet.
Even the mystical movements in America, whose trend
is anti-scientific, like to trick themselves out with the
name of “Science,” which has a kind of magic sound
and glamour for the men of the New World.</p>

<p>There is the same universal enthusiasm for art in
America. It might be said that America is determined
to admire everything which might possibly be beautiful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
of every country, every epoch, and every school. It is
true that the most engrossing preoccupation of the
Americans is not that of fostering the arts; they must
still keep their minds fixed on the conquest of their
great continent. But it is also true that, in the moments
of leisure, when they can think of something
other than business, they fling open, so to speak, their
arms to the arts of the whole world. Just as all the
styles of architecture can be found in the great buildings
of New York, so all the arts which have flourished in
the course of centuries in Asia and Europe have been
transplanted into the New World. America, I might
almost say, wishes to taste and understand all the
beauties which the past has created; classical literature
as well as contemporary European literature, Italian
as well as German music, Greek sculpture as well as
the French sculpture of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, Italian as well as Dutch painting, Japanese
decorative art as well as the styles of the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth Louis. New York, from this
point of view, is a real artistic cosmopolis.</p>

<p>If, then, Europe is gradually destroying her ancient
culture, and her great traditions, in order to construct
railways and factories, to found banks and to initiate
commercial enterprises, America, on the other hand,
wishes to employ the wealth gained by the intensive
exploitation of her vast continent in creating an art
and a science. How can we explain this contrast?
“The snobbery of a parvenue nation,” it pleases the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
European, with a shrug of the shoulders, to label it.
But anyone with any knowledge of America and much
knowledge of human nature will not rest content with
so glib an explanation. It is true that, thanks to
machinery, to America, and to the idea of liberty and
progress, quantity is to-day triumphant in the world.
Men wish to enjoy abundance. Can they, however,
confine their wish to abundance, to the increase, that
is to say, of the quantity of things they possess? Observe
a peasant who comes to town, turns artisan, and
earns a higher wage. What does he do? Does he buy
with his higher wage a second pair of boots, or a second
suit in addition to and like the one he wore when he was
poor? No. He adopts the town fashions and buys
more elegant shoes and clothes, in appearance at least,
that is to say, like those worn by the upper classes. In
every country of America and Europe, the differences
in dress between the upper and lower classes, once so
great, are disappearing. And why? Because the people
want to dress like the “Swells”; and modern industry
spares no trouble to give them at little cost the means
of satisfying their ambition. In other words, the
workman wants to invest his higher wage in the purchase
of finer, or what he thinks are finer, clothes, than
those he wore before, because to possess a suit of superior
clothes is to him a greater joy than to have two
suits of the same workmanship as those he wore when
he was poorer. In other words, quantity soon satiates,
and at a certain stage man needs to translate it into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
quality, and to employ his wealth to procure for himself,
not a greater number of things, but more beautiful
and better things, otherwise wealth is useless.</p>

<p>If this need is lively and profound in the minds of the
people, how much stronger must it be in the richer
classes, those with great resources at their disposal!
A man who possesses ten millions and another who
possesses one hundred cannot eat ten and a hundred
times as much respectively as the modest lord of only
one million, live in a house ten or a hundred times as
vast, or buy himself ten or a hundred hats where the
other buys only one. If they used their wealth in that
way, they would be considered mad, and with good reason.
They must then strive to procure for themselves,
with their superior wealth, things of superior beauty or
quality, to translate their wealth into beauty and merit,
quantity into quality. There are, it is true, men who
desire wealth only for the pleasure of creating it, and
who are indifferent to the other pleasures which it
brings. At no time, perhaps, were these men so numerous
as at present among the great bankers, merchants,
and manufacturers who now rule the economic destinies
of the modern world. But even to-day, these men, who
love money as the artist loves his art, in itself and not
for the pleasures which it can give, are in a minority.
And so they will always be, because even if—impossible
hypothesis—anybody in the upper classes developed
such a fervid enthusiasm for banking, industry, and
commerce, as to arrive at considering wealth only as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
end in itself, a means of displaying his own ability,
there would still be the women. Unless it be wished
that even in the wealthy classes, women should engage
in business and work, women will be bound always
to consider wealth as an instrument for the advancement
of life, procuring for its possessor joys more
select and articles of superior quality.</p>

<p>In fact, this and no other is the origin of snobbery.
Snobbery is, I know, an obvious target for sarcasm at
the present day. And it is easy to laugh at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nouveau
riche</i> who is determined at all costs, even at the price
of sacrifice and snubs, to frequent houses and circles
which formerly were closed to him; who is glad to go
for trips in a motor-car, even if they cause him suffering,
or to go to the opera even if he falls asleep there, because
he thinks that by doing so, he is living up to the
standard of the highest elegance. But if he were not
under this delusion, what would be the use of his
wealth to him? What compensation would he have
for the fatigues and perils he had incurred in its acquisition?
Snobbery is simply an effort to translate quantity
into quality to which man is impelled by the very
increase of wealth. There never was so much snobbery
as there is at the present time, because there never was
so much wealth.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, modern snobbery is full of grotesque
deceptions. The world never contained so many
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nouveaux riches</i>, unprepared to enjoy the real refinements
of life, and destined to be the victims of every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
sort of fraud. How often and in how many instances
do we not see the tragi-comedy of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i>,
Molière’s immortal comedy, acted over again
at the present day? But one can also find, in America
perhaps more abundantly than in Europe, families
whose wealth dates back several generations, in which
families the mania for the accumulation of riches has
died down, and which have time, inclination, and culture
enough to employ their wealth on behalf of the
most lofty activities of the mind. These are the American
families who ransack Europe for works of art, who
found schools and museums, who give work to architects,
painters, and sculptors, who directly or indirectly
stimulate an ever-increasing number of the rising
generation not to concentrate on the making of money,
but to devote themselves to those intellectual labours
of which, till a short while ago, Europe had the
monopoly. And it is the existence of this portion of
American society and its tendencies that entitle us to
say that America is being Europeanised.</p>

<p>Europe, then, wishing to live a larger life, after
centuries of penury and stint, is becoming Americanised,
and is sacrificing a part of her splendid traditions
of lofty culture to her desire to learn from America the
art of producing new wealth rapidly. America, on the
other hand, having accumulated immense wealth by
the intensive exploitation of her territory, is becoming
Europeanised; she is turning, that is to say, to the arts,
sciences, and most lofty forms of higher culture, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
perfect which Europe has laboured for centuries. Yet
at this point I think I hear the reader cry:</p>

<p>“Is not this all to the good? Does it not establish a
marvellous balance between the two worlds? Does it
not prove that our civilisation is the richest, most
powerful, best balanced, and most perfect which has
ever existed? Ought Europe to have gone on living
for ever in misery, intent only on the perfecting of
culture, and America to have had never a thought for
anything but the multiplication of wealth?”</p>

<p>To be sure, if this exchange of wealth and culture
between the two continents could be effected as well
and easily as it can be described, our epoch would be in
very truth an epoch of fabulous felicity. We might
claim to be, in comparison with preceding generations,
a generation of supermen. Unfortunately, the difficulties
are greater than they seem at first sight to be.
What they are will be seen in the next chapter; we shall
then see that it has become much easier to produce new
wealth than to employ it in the creation of a lofty and
refined civilisation; and that this is the secret torment
which afflicts Europe and America.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LOST PARADISE OF BEAUTY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> bewildering growth in the wealth of America
has affected in many different ways the whole
world. Economists are studying its effects with much
zeal. One, and not the least curious, of them, is the
rise in the value of antiques. From Etruscan ceramics
to French furniture of the eighteenth century, from
Greek statues to Italian pictures of every epoch, from
Tanagra statuettes to the lace, embroideries, tapestries,
manuscripts, glass, and filigree from every part of the
world, all the artistic furniture of Europe, Asia, and
Africa which has survived the ravages of time has
trebled and quadrupled its value. Few financial speculations
proved more successful in Europe than the
collection about fifty years ago of antiques.</p>

<p>Many instances could be quoted to prove this.
Everybody, even in America, I suppose, has heard
recently of the great Paris tailor who set to work thirty
years ago to collect statues, pictures, and French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">objets
d’art</i> of the eighteenth century. He spent about three
millions on his collection; and he put it up for auction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
last year and cleared fourteen millions! An occurrence
which made less noise, because it was on a smaller scale,
but analogous to the foregoing, is the following: A
journalist, a man of taste and a great admirer of
beautiful antiques, came to Rome. Everybody called
him a maniac, because, though he had a family, he
spent all his savings in buying from the small antique
dealers and in the Campo di Fiori lamps, books, stuffs,
and every other bit of antique he could lay hands on.
Well, he died ten years ago, and left his family nothing
but a houseful of fine antiques. The family, which
did not share his mania, sold them, and realised a fortune,
the income of which was, and is, enough to support
them in comfort. If the journalist had been
discreet and had invested his savings in shares and
bonds, probably his family would now be living in a
very much humbler way.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to quote further evidence in support
of so notorious a fact. Ask any European antiquarian
the reason for this appreciation, and he will reply unhesitatingly,
“America.” America for the last thirty
years has been making assaults on the antiquities-market
with all the tenacity of her untiring activity,
and the might of her new-made wealth. Some people
in Europe—those who have antiques to sell—are very
glad that it should be so. Others lament, complaining
that Europe is emptying herself of her treasures in
favour of the New World. Most people, however,
smile at what they consider a proof of the incurable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
snobbery of the New World. Europe is very ready to
accuse America of loving antiques only because they
are rare and, therefore, dear; of fighting dollar-duels
about them, only to prove their own wealth, without
any power of judging and distinguishing between the
good and the bad, though even among antiques there
are ugly as well as beautiful ones, representing comparative
grades of beauty. And this accusation too is,
in its general application, unjust and unsubstantial.
Anybody who has had any extensive dealings with the
wealthy houses of New York, Boston, Philadelphia,
Washington, and Chicago, knows that they contain
many Americans who are competent judges and buyers
of artistic antiques. It is true that, from this point of
view, the big American houses cannot yet challenge
comparison with the big European houses. Nevertheless,
numberless are the marvellous ceramics from the
Far East, numberless the magnificent pieces of French
eighteenth century furniture, numberless the pieces of
wonderful lace, glass, and antique <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">boiseries</i> which it
has been my good fortune to see, not without an
occasional pang, in America.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this reproach, which, couched in
its usual form, is unjust, contains a modicum of truth,
which however applies to Europe as well as to America.
I have often had occasion to notice in wealthy modern
houses—in Europe as well as in America, but in America
more than in Europe—that they are adorned
with many extremely beautiful old pieces, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
these are too numerous, and too heterogeneous. You
find in a modern drawing-room material of every epoch
and from all parts of the world; from ancient Greece,
and from China of the last century, from the Italian
Middle Ages and from contemporary Persia. Consequently
modern houses are too much like small
museums, in which numbers of wonderful little antiques,
picked up wherever they were to be had, are exposed
to view, and in which the modern furniture and adornments
serve as the show-case in which the antiques are
displayed, instead of being, as they were in the eighteenth
century, the principal decoration, of which some
beautiful antique was the appropriate ornament and
complement. This inversion of the natural order of
things would be inexplicable, were we not all of us
persuaded more or less consciously that old things must
necessarily be more beautiful than modern ones. For
this reason we are willing that what we make, the
modern, shall be subordinated and serve as a tool to
the antique.</p>

<p>In short, the antique, in Europe as in America, has
acquired nowadays a value of its own in art, merely
on the score of its antiquity. I need not dwell on the
strangeness of this prejudice in favour of antiques in
an age and in countries in which, directly one leaves
the field of art behind, one finds so keen a craze for the
modern. Not to be up-to-date is at the present day the
greatest reproach we can fling at a man in Europe and
in America, especially in America. Why then does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
modernity in art arouse, not only in old Europe, but
also, and perhaps more, in young America, so much
diffidence and mistrust? Why do we, notwithstanding
the attempts which modern artists make to emulate
the ancients or to create new things, turn to the past
when we want to possess or enjoy something really
beautiful? May this contradiction be the effort of a
last surviving prejudice? For centuries, man was
educated to consider all antique things, only because
they were antique, preferable to modern ones. In
many respects, we have conquered this venerable prejudice.
May our attachment to the antique in art be
the last and most persistent survival of this sentiment,
itself destined to disappear?</p>

<p>No. This persistent attachment to the antique in
art is not prejudice; it is the effect of the incurable
artistic weakness of our epoch. Men are following a
profound and sure instinct when, in their desire for
beauty, they turn to the antique; for art is as it were the
lost Paradise of our civilisation, whose atmosphere we
are always breathing, but to which the entrance is
forbidden us. It is a phenomenon of contemporary
life which usually attracts but little attention; and yet
how strange it is! The need for the adornment of life
with beautiful things—for translating quantity into
quality, as I said above—has not diminished among
the wealthy classes, and could not diminish, because it
is a profoundly human need. The world’s upper classes
never had so much wealth at their disposal as now, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
never had so keen a desire to spend a considerable part
of it in the purchase of beautiful things. How many
artistic masterpieces could have been paid for, and how
many painters, sculptors, and architects of genius
liberally rewarded with half the sums which have been
spent in raising fourfold or sixfold the value of the
antiquities of Europe, Asia, and Africa? Indeed the
immense growth in the world’s wealth has profited
the dead, not the living, in the world of art, antiquities
and not the modern arts. And it was inevitable that
this should be so. Why?</p>

<p>Because modern times are not adapted to be a golden
age of art, for a psychological and moral reason, which,
however, is not to be sought in the practical and commercial
spirit of modern times. Many of the fairest
palaces and pictures which we admire in Italy were
commissioned by merchants who were no less practical
than modern bankers. The reason is to be sought elsewhere,
and it is more profound. Modern civilisation
has conquered with its railways, telegraphs, and steam-boats,
the whole earth. In fifty years, it has succeeded
in conquering continents so vast as North America.
It has created riches so fabulous, in a word, it has
achieved so much power, because it has broken through
all the limits within which the spirit of tradition confined
past generations. Escaping from these limits, it
has learned to create at great speed. Speed and the tireless
spirit of innovation are the two formidable weapons
which have given our civilisation the victory in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
struggle with nature and with the other more conservative
and more deliberate civilisations. But the
qualities necessary to artistic excellence are just the two
opposite qualities: the spirit of tradition and laborious
deliberateness.</p>

<p>We moderns, victims of the giddy pace at which we
live, may be somewhat oblivious of the fact; but it is a
fact that anyone who knows history cannot ignore.
To create and foster an art really worthy of the name,—Greek
sculpture, Italian painting, the French decorative
art of the eighteenth century,—the immense sums
at our disposal are useless, and the sciences of steam and
electricity of no avail. I have already had occasion to
prove this in the preceding chapters. The nations and
the generations which have created the most famous
arts and whose relics are still our delight, were poor
and ignorant compared with us. In order to create and
foster art, it is necessary to educate generations of
artists to do good work and generations of amateurs to
understand and appreciate it. Neither the artists nor
the public taste can be educated without a spirit of
tradition and of æsthetic discipline, which induces the
public to allow the artists the time necessary for the
perfecting of their respective arts in all their details;
which induces the artist to recognise the legitimate
requirements of the public for which he works, and to
seek to satisfy it by adapting his own work to those
requirements.</p>

<p>Anyone can see, however, that nowadays these two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
conditions have become well-nigh impossible. In the
gigantic confusion of the modern world, races, cultures,
and populations are continually intermingling. Generations
follow each other with the fixed determination
not to continue what their immediate predecessor has
done but to do something different. Ancient traditions
are dying out, and no new ones are being formed or can
be formed. Change is the order of the day. Sons but
rarely adopt their father’s professions, and not a few
die in lands other than those in which they were born.
Modern society is agitated by a continual process of
renewal, which is the deep-seated source of her energy
and activity, but is also a reason for her artistic decadence.
In this continual mobility of bodies, wills,
and ideas; in this perpetual change of tendencies, tastes,
and standards, art is losing her bearings and, alone in
this age of bold enterprises, is becoming greedy and
diffident.</p>

<p>Public and artists, instead of helping each other, have
grown timid. The public no longer does what it likes.
It no longer has any standard of judgment. It has
become timid and diffident. It is obsessed by the fear
of mistaking a masterpiece for a deception or a deception
for a masterpiece. This uncertainty of tastes and
desires in the public in its turn bewilders the artists.
When the painter, the sculptor, the musician, and the
poet try to find in the desires and inclinations of the
public the sure indication which in times past used to
be the support and guidance of artists in their creations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
they find that the public is ready to admire anything,
but has no marked preference for anything in particular.
The artist is free, but his liberty is a liberty which
embarrasses and paralyses him.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the adroit artists quickly
learn the art of exploiting the uncertainties and inexperiences
of the public, and win riches and honours.
The crazy and the charlatans seek to intimidate the public
by perpetrating novelties of extravagant audacity.
Serious and conscientious artists there are nowadays,
of course, but everyone has new formulæ of his
own art, differing from those of everyone else, and
proclaims his to be the only true, fruitful, and admirable
formulæ, at the same time denouncing all others as
freaks. By what standard are we to judge these
quarrels? Bewildered by so many different attempts
and judgments, the public ends by turning to the
antique. It has a vague idea that the past ages may
have been inferior to our own in all other respects, but
in art were superior to it. It knows that a work of art
at least one century old may be more or less beautiful,
but that it is at least a serious work of art, conceived
and carried out in good faith, not for the mystification of
an ingenuous public by some daring theory of novelty.</p>

<p>So the Europeans are wrong in ridiculing the passion
of the Americans for ancient things. This passion has
the same origin on the other side of the Atlantic as it
has on this. In art, our civilisation is destined to
remain inferior to ancient civilisations, which it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
overshadowed with its wisdom, its power, and its
wealth. This is the reason for the rapid growth in the
value of the antique in art, even in the age of modernity
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à outrance</i>. We need feel no shame in avowing it
openly. Civilisations and epochs, like individuals, cannot
have and expect everything; and the share which
has fallen to us of the good things of the earth is so
large, that we can readily console ourselves for the
loss of this particular one.</p>

<p>Who reasoned thus would reason wisely. Nevertheless,
the fact is of greater importance than it appears.
It shows that the balance between the ancient culture
of Europe and the spirit of American culture—that
balance which might perhaps have produced the most
brilliant civilisation in history—will never be perfectly
secured, at least so long as the conditions of the world
remain what they now are. America will be able to
continue her Europeanisation, and Europe her Americanisation,
as we have seen is the case. But this
interchange of influences will not have as its only result
the increase of the wealth of Europe and of the culture
of America. It will give birth in the two worlds to a
discontent and an unrest which nothing will be able to
allay.</p>

<p>In fact, the more its upper classes come under the
influence of the culture of the Old World, the more
ardent will become the admiration and desire of
America for the antique,—for that beauty which the
civilisations preceding our own created with such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
wealth and perfection of forms; the more strongly will
it be convinced of our artistic inferiority, and persuaded
that one of the treasures of life we have lost irreparably,
and can only enjoy in the relics of other generations.
Every picture or statue or artistic object which crosses
the ocean and enters America, every museum which a
rich Maecenas opens in the New World to the public
or which a city or a state creates, every chair founded,
and every book of artistic history printed,—everything,
in fact, which brings the spirit of America into contact
with the masterpieces of ancient European art, and
awakens recognition and admiration for them, makes
America at the same time recognise how comparatively
decadent is that which our times produce; reveals to it
that lost Paradise of Beauty around whose closed gates
we are now condemned to hover. This contact with
the artistic achievement of the past becomes, therefore,
at the same time a gadfly of discontent and unrest to
the upper and cultured classes.</p>

<p>By an inverse process, the further the spirit of American
progress penetrates into Europe, the more completely
does it detach the Old World from its past, and,
therefore, irritates, grieves, and disgusts the classes
which have enough culture to recognise and admire the
marvellous arts of that past. With every ten years
that elapse, we feel that our past, with all its radiant
glories, has receded a hundred years; that we are plunging
into a new world, in which riches, knowledge, and
our power over nature will increase, but which will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
be ugly, inharmonious, and vulgar compared with the
centuries which preceded it. Many Americans fail to
understand why Europe cherishes so many latent
antipathies to America, which has never done her
any harm, directly at least. The real reason for these
antipathies must be looked for in the artistic decadence
which accompanies the development of modern civilisation.
That civilisation has not been created by America
alone, but by America and Europe combined. Europe
and America, therefore, share the responsibility
for this decadence. Yet it suits the European book
from time to time to see in America the symbol of the
civilisation of railways, steam, electricity, business, and
industry on a large scale; and Europeans gladly vent
on America their spleen for whatever in this civilisation,
pregnant with good and with evil, offends them and
arouses regret.</p>

<p>In short, there is an insoluble contradiction between
progress, as our age understands the word,—between the
“American” progress, as many Europeans call it,—and
art. This contradiction has as yet attracted but little
notice, in the still great confusion in which we live, in
the initial tumult of this new civilisation which is invading
the earth. It will be noticed, however, more and
more strongly, as generation succeeds generation, and
in many families the primary hunger for wealth is
satiated and gives way to the desire to “translate
quantity into quality”: as American love for the
historical beauties of the Old World increases, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Europe takes further lessons in the multiplication of her
wealth. There is no escape or salvation for our civilisation
from the discontent and unrest which will arise
from this contradiction. It is a torment which will
grow with the growth of wealth and culture; which
nations and classes will feel more acutely the richer
and the more cultivated they become; from which perhaps,
one day, America will suffer more severely than
many European nations; which will oppress the upper
classes much more heavily than the people. The latter,
indeed, will not feel it at all, and will alone be able to
live in modern civilisation, as contented as man ever
can be in this world.</p>

<p>History often has strange surprises in store. The
civilisation of machinery tended at its birth to appear
as a death-blow to the working classes, a godsend to the
upper classes. For years and years, socialism, generalising
from the initial rubs, predicted and pretended to
prove that the great mechanical industry must enrich
a small oligarchy inordinately, and reduce to the
blackest wretchedness the great mass of the population;
that a new feudalism of capitalists, fiercer than the
barons of the Middle Ages, would seize all the good
things of the world. A century passes, and we find this
civilisation giving complete satisfaction only to the
workmen, because it can content the workmen only
from the double point of view of quantity and quality.
It gives them an abundance which only a small fraction
of the people enjoyed up to a century ago; and, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
the same time, bestows on them a luxury which fully
satisfies their yet simple and unsophisticated æsthetic
sense. We may smile when we see in a workman’s
home mirrors and clocks which are the rudest imitations
of masterpieces of the Louis XV and Louis XVI styles,
hideous reproductions from a German factory; and
coarse carpets which are poor European copies of
beautiful Turkish and Persian models, the result of the
substitution of the iron teeth of a machine for the
industrious fingers of the human hand, and of decadent
aniline dyes for the brilliant and unfading vegetable
colours. The workman, however, does not know the
matchless models of which these objects are the ugly
copies, and, inasmuch as every æsthetic verdict arises
out of a comparison, these reproductions represent for
him the summit of perfection, and entirely satisfy his
need for beautiful things round about him.</p>

<p>To the upper classes, on the other hand, this civilisation
has given immense and imposing wealth, such as
no epoch had ever considered possible; but it has deprived
them of the means of enjoying it. Wealth
becomes nowadays more useless, the greater it becomes,
because a multi-millionaire cannot build himself a house,
wear clothes, or buy objects a hundred times finer and
better than the possessor of only a few millions. We no
longer have artists capable of accomplishing miracles.
The men of great wealth are forced to compete with
each other for the relics of past beauty at fabulous
prices, when they are not inclined to spend all their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
wealth for the benefit of others. These relics are not
sufficient, however, to satisfy the desire for beauty and
art which grows in our times with the growth of wealth
and of culture. On the contrary, they only make us
feel more acutely the decadent vulgarity of everything,
with but few exceptions, which our age produces.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Someone will say that, after all, this torment is not a
very serious one; and that men will easily find means of
consoling themselves. No epoch, as I have already said,
can have everything; and modern civilisation bestows
on the wealthy classes of our times numberless compensations
for the ugliness of the modern world. One of
these should be enough by itself to content even the
most discontented: that kind of bodily and mental
ubiquity which is enjoyed, thanks to the prodigious
inventions of modern genius. Cannot the wealthy,
thanks to their riches, remove from one continent to
another, travel, have dealings and acquaintances in,
and receive communications from, every part of the
world, come to know the most distant and recondite
beauties of nature and of art—in a word, live over the
whole globe? A modern great man may well feel
himself almost a demigod compared with the men of
two centuries ago, so great is the sway his money gives
him over the forces of nature, so easily can he escape
from the tyranny which space and time used to exercise
over men up to a century ago. May not the intoxication
of this proud sway be worth as much as the pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
which the works of Phidias, Michelangelo, Raphael,
and Houdon gave to our ancestors?</p>

<p>It is true that the pride of our knowledge and the
intoxication of our power stun us, and therefore help us
to bear with greater patience the want of more æsthetic
pleasures. But this compensation, like all compensations,
is of its very nature provisional. It is not possible
utterly to destroy a need inherent in human nature.
There is at the present day a certain tendency in the
world to consider art as a superfluous frivolity, as a
luxury only to be thought of in moments of leisure.
Art and such-like superfluities are contrasted with what
are called the serious occupations, the practical realities
of life: industry, commerce, inventions, business, and
wealth. Those who hold this opinion forget, however,
that the sculptures of Phidias and the paintings of
Raphael appeared in the world long before the steam-engine
and the Voltaic pile. Are we, too, prepared in
face of this fact to affirm, with the most advanced
champion of the American idea of progress in my
dialogue, that “history was off the track up to the discovery
of America”? That if men had had any sense,
they would have invented machinery and developed
the sciences first, and then created and developed the
arts? But even if we were prepared to maintain this
paradoxical theory, another fact of common observation
would be there to prove to us that beauty is not a
luxury and whim of gentlemen of leisure, but a primary,
universal, and indestructible need of our minds, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
every human creature seeks to satisfy as best it can.
Do we not see every day that the peasant and the
artisan, items in modern civilisation though they are,
no sooner have a little money than they try to procure
for themselves ornaments, either for their persons or for
their homes, which may be as tawdry as you like, but
which to them seem beautiful and well worth the expenditure
of some of the little money they have? Have
we not seen that one of the merits of modern civilisation
is that of satisfying the æsthetic needs of the masses?
Why should we not expect, then, to find the same need,
though in a refined and intense form, felt by those to
whom superior intelligence and energy, or the favour
of fortune, has granted the power to accumulate wealth
in large quantities, those, in other words, who have at
their disposal greater means of procuring for themselves
the pleasures and good things of life?</p>

<p>No: the artistic impotence of modern civilisation is
likely to prove, to judge by the first effects which are
now beginning to manifest themselves, a graver phenomenon
than is at present realised. The upper classes
in Europe and America will not be able to go on for an
indefinite length of time living with a consciousness that
the world in which they find themselves is ugly, coarse,
and decadent in comparison with preceding civilisations;
feeling the inferiority of the present more acutely
the more they study, and at the same time extending
still further their sway over the world and accumulating
new riches to console themselves for it. This would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
a state of moral want of balance; and moral want of
balance cannot continue indefinitely, just as physical
want of balance cannot continue indefinitely. Either
our civilisation will abate its aspirations to the level
of the mediocrity which it is capable of producing in art,
destroying in itself the remembrance of and regret for
those ancient civilisations which created so many beautiful
things; or it will have to put itself into a position
to satisfy not only the æsthetic needs of the masses, but
also those of the more cultured and refined strata of
society. The first supposition appears improbable, or
at least no man of sense will wish to consider it possible.
It would mean a relapse of the world into barbarism,
the end of all the traditions and all the studies which
have been and still are an indispensable element of
intellectual and moral refinement. So we are left with
the other hypothesis, which assumes that man will
make up his mind one day to make an effort to create
arts of his own, which will survive comparison with
those of the past.</p>

<p>Yet the task is an arduous one. As I have already
said, an art is not created or perfected without the
spirit of tradition and of discipline; and the attempt
in our times to re-infuse vigour into the spirit of tradition
and of discipline, if only in the measure necessary
for the progress of art, is an enterprise, the difficulties
of which everyone can understand without a long
explanation. It cannot be effected without a profound
intellectual and moral reform, which will bring about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
change in many things besides the originality and power
of the arts which are to-day languid and decadent. So
the struggle between American progress and art may
well be a more important phenomenon than is at
present apparent; and may well entail transformations
of far-reaching extent.</p>

<span class="subhead">BEYOND EVERY LIMIT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">For</span> century after century, our civilisation lay low
in its Mediterranean lair. It knew but a small
part of Europe, Asia, and Africa; and no pricks of curiosity
impelled it to ascertain how far the world extended
over land and sea beyond the vague bounds which
marked the limit of its efforts. That small part of the
world satisfied the ambitions of our ancestors, though
they certainly were not shy and craven. Confined in
that narrow corner of the earth and with only the scanty
resources which it could provide, they created literatures,
arts, philosophies, states, laws, and religions.
Some of these creations are alive to this day, and help
us distant descendants to shed a little beauty and to
impose a little order on the modern world.</p>

<p>Between the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries
there began a great change in the history of our civilisation.
Impelled by the wish to reach India by way of
the Atlantic, our forefathers began to explore the earth.
Gradually geographical exploration became the preoccupation
of governments, the passion of the public,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
and the business of a great number of persons who made
almost a vocation of these daring voyages. And behold
one fine day, one grand day, the most fortunate and
daring of the navigators who were exploring the Atlantic
in every direction discovered America. In mid-Atlantic
there lay two connected continents, stretching from
one hemisphere to the other, covering many latitudes
and a great variety of clime, and much of this vast
territory was still but sparsely inhabited. It was then
that our forefathers realised how vast and rich was the
earth, and how small and poor in comparison seemed
that Mediterranean world in which for so many centuries
they had lived. It was then that they began to
pass beyond the limits within which they had been so
long confined, to invade and to conquer the outside
world.</p>

<p>The Pillars of Hercules, which had been the impassable
geographical limit of the ancient Mediterranean
world, were not, however, the only bounds which they
passed; they transcended also the moral and intellectual
limits which until then had circumscribed their thoughts
and actions. All the time that the ancient Mediterranean
civilisation, turned loose into the Atlantic, was
striking root and expanding in America, an uninterrupted
sequence of events and movements was
taking place in Europe, destroying ancient laws, ancient
traditions, and ancient discipline; upsetting, in other
words, the bounds placed in the past to the thought,
the sentiment, and the will of Man. The most important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
of these events were: the Protestant Reformation,
the philosophies of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, the advances of science, the French Revolution
and its wars, the birth and the development of the
great industrial movement, and the all but universal
triumph of democratic ideas.</p>

<p>Little by little, while the aspect of the globe changed,
a great revolution was taking place in the spirit of the
ancient Christian civilisation in Europe, which from
being dictatorial and traditionalist became free and
progressive. Religion, which for so many centuries
had been a kind of severe moral discipline, a life of
prohibitions, scruples, rules, precepts, ceremonies, and
rites, changed into a kind of free contemplation of the
Deity in which the individual conscience had full play.
Everybody became his own high priest.</p>

<p>The ceremonial of social life, which at no time had
been so complicated, serious, and exacting, gradually
became so far simplified as no longer to encumber man
in his every movement and activity. The State, which
at one time, hand-in-hand with religion, watched over
the customs and life of its citizens, accorded greater and
greater liberty to them. To-day everybody, provided
he contributes to society his daily sum of work, is free
to live and think as he likes. Severe laws used once
upon a time to regulate men’s luxuries and pleasures.
Every class was forbidden to spend its money in any
way other than that prescribed by these laws. There
were times of the year in which men were forbidden to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
amuse themselves, and, when amusements were allowed,
the laws took care that they should not degenerate into
vice. Nowadays the whole year is one long festival
and carnival for all who have money to spend; and
together with freedom in pleasure men have acquired
also a freedom in vice which would scandalise our
friends the ancients, if they might come back to life
again.</p>

<p>Every authority is losing power. The people discuss
the government and the laws; children take the first
opportunity of escaping from the authority of their
parents. The younger generation is convinced that it
knows more than the older, and values the latter’s
experience at zero. Traditions are losing their force
and academics their prestige. Everyone holds the
opinion he likes in religious, artistic, political, and moral
questions; just as he is free to regulate his own conduct,
at his own risk and peril, as he pleases, with the sole
obligation of respecting the limits imposed by the laws,
which are for the most part neither numerous nor
embarrassing.</p>

<p>What is the deep-lying cause of this duplex and contemporaneous
movement? Why has the old Christian
civilisation of Europe felt itself in the last four centuries
unable any longer either to contain itself within the
ancient material limits or within the ancient ideal
limits? Why, at the same moment as it advances to
the conquest of new continents, does it destroy within
itself all the ancient disciplinary restrictions? Because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
in these last centuries it has gradually discovered that
the earth is much vaster and richer than it suspected;
that it contains, in old Europe, as well as in young
America, treasures in much greater abundance than
it had ever pictured in its dreams; and that it can invent
tools which bring these rapidly within its reach.
Gradually, as man found that he could rob nature of her
immense treasures, there arose and spread from generation
to generation through all classes in Europe and
America a craze for wealth and a mad ambition to win
the mastery over nature, such as the world had never
yet seen.</p>

<p>To satisfy this craze and this ambition, however, it
was necessary to break many of the innumerable bonds—religious,
moral, æsthetic, and political,—which
limited the energy and initiative of our forefathers.
How could so many millions of men have brought
themselves to emigrate to America, if the spirit of
tradition had not been weakened in Europe, and if
everybody had continued to hold, as they did once upon
a time, that the greatest good fortune a man could have
was that of being buried in the church in which he had
been baptised? Even to-day there are those who
lament the diminution, in all the Christian churches
during the last few centuries, of the number, complexity,
and rigour of the rites and ceremonies, just as others
lament that the ceremonial of social life and etiquette
is dying out. But would not men who are obliged to
work, travel, and rush about as we do nowadays find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
themselves embarrassed beyond the point of endurance
by a religion which made them spend too much time
over rites, and by a complicated etiquette like that
which still prevails in the states of the East, requiring a
large part of the day to be spent in compliments and
ceremonies? Europeans often laugh at the architecture
of New York; and I must confess that I, too, found it
distinctly bizarre. On the other hand, could that vast
city have grown and renovated itself so rapidly in
the last century, and have found accommodation for the
countless multitudes which throng to it from all the
corners of the world, if those who built it had troubled
themselves to observe the rules formulated by the great
architects of the sixteenth century, in the days when it
took as much time to build a palace and a church as it
now does to construct a city?</p>

<p>Modern society, if compared with the societies which
preceded it, may seem in many of its aspects—and in
fact it is—ugly, poor in artistic beauty, coarse, and
brutal. It may even seem atheistic and irreverent,
frivolous and superficial in matters of religion, and, in
certain respects, morally lax or downright licentious.
This kind of disorder, however, which is such a common
subject of heart-burning, is only the necessary effect of
the outburst of our energy over the world and nature
on its path of conquest. A civilisation cannot produce,
refine, or perfect arts or traditions of elegance and of
social life, or a morality and a religion, if it does not
adopt an attitude of reserve, if it does not limit itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
to some extent, if it does not sacrifice its other ambitions
and aspirations to this object. A civilisation like
ours, whose supreme aspiration it is to extend in the
shortest possible time and as far as it can its empire
over the world; to surpass all the limits which nature
seeks to oppose to its restless ambitions and to the
multiform energy of man, must needs sacrifice beauty,
refinement, elegance, and moral delicacy to rapidity,
energy, activity, and daring. The discovery and development
of new countries, the marvellous progress of
America, the discoveries of science, the perfection of
machinery, the ideas of liberty which emerge triumphant
from political revolutions and changes in customs,
the weakening of the spirit of authority in every department
of social life, the abolition of so many limits
which once entangled the movements of man, are
all phenomena which are mutually and indissolubly
connected.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>“Yes,” many will say; “and they are phenomena
which all go to make up the grandeur and glory of the
modern world. We have power, wealth, knowledge,
and liberty, the four blessings of which our forefathers
had little, if any, knowledge. What cause have we
then to grumble? And amongst all the blessings which
modern times shower upon us, perhaps the most
precious—more precious than wealth, power, and
knowledge—is liberty. If we have no reason to regret
the past, it is chiefly because our forefathers lived,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
imprisoned, and in suffering, within limits which we
have overstepped. Is there any greater joy for a man
than that of being able in thought, feeling, and action
to follow the inner impulse of his own conscience,
instead of making it bend to an external will, whether it
be that of the law, or that of the public, or that of a
tradition? Surely the modern world is the greatest as
well as the most fortunate which has ever existed?”</p>

<p>That is what many people think, and thoughts like
this breed the optimism which at the present day cheers
so many minds. This thought is, moreover, partially
true; but only partially. For in the intoxication of
their triumph over nature, of the riches which they
have conquered so easily and in such abundance, men
seem not to recognise that this civilisation without
limits is little by little allowing that same unbridled
energy to hurry it into excesses which threaten to drive
it back into that very state of barbarism from which it
has made so many efforts to escape. The impetus
which it has acquired, now that it has cast off so many
of its ancient restraints, is great; but the danger is
precisely that this impetus may carry it too far.</p>

<p>I have already said that amongst the limits abolished
by modern civilisation are those which preceding civilisations
had placed on luxury. How great a change has
taken place in men’s ideas on this subject during two
centuries! Simplicity and austerity were considered
for centuries virtues proper to saints and heroes.
Christianity had gone so far as to glorify poverty in so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
many words. Man, by increasing his needs, only increased
the number of his masters and tyrants; only
multiplied for himself occasions for sorrow. The more
simply a man could live, the freer, stronger, and happier
he was. In short, in ancient times, up to the French
Revolution, religion, law, and tradition set limits on
every side to man’s desire to possess and to enjoy;
and these limits were so numerous and so close, that
they entailed no little suffering on the generations constrained
to live within them. That is why we have upset
them all. And what is the result? That we no
longer have any sure criterion by which to distinguish
reasonable consumption from insensate waste, legitimate
need from vice. We can no longer say what are the
limits at which it is reasonable and wise for the peasant,
the artisan, the small tradesman, the man of leisure,
the millionaire, the multi-millionaire, the child, the
woman, the old man, respectively, to cry a halt to their
desires. All men and all classes arrogate to themselves
the right to desire, to spend, even to waste as
much as they can. No one has any clear idea of a
standard by which to distinguish what he may desire
and what he ought to deny himself. A kind of universal
prodigality is becoming obligatory in every class; and
modern civilisation is hurrying towards an unbridled,
gross, and oppressive orgy. There is already a large
number of men in Europe and America who eat, drink,
and smoke to excess; who over-indulge in intoxicating
and stimulating drinks; and who spend themselves in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
that continual whirl of diversions and distractions which
form so large a part of modern life. The number is
fated, however, to grow yet larger, rapidly and indefinitely.
Is not production increasing on every side?
Is not progress for us first and foremost the continual
increase of production? And what avails it to produce
more, if the riches produced do not find consumers?</p>

<p>The modern world, in freeing men’s desires from all
the ancient limits and restraints, has given a vigorous
impulse to human industry. In order to satisfy the
increased needs of the masses, man has invented
machinery, and has put a premium on the new countries.
But precisely because there is no longer limit or
restraint to men’s desires, industry, which in the past was
the handmaiden of human needs, is now becoming their
tyrant. It is creating and multiplying our needs with
a view to their subsequent satisfaction. In order that
it may never be short of work, it is tempting men in a
thousand ways to desire and to consume more. Therefore
our civilisation has made of riches not the fitting
means of satisfying reasonable and legitimate needs,
but an end in themselves. We are obliged to produce
them in order to consume them, and to consume them
in order to produce them. Every moment which a man
does not spend in producing riches, he must spend in
consuming the riches produced by others; so that he
can never stay still for one instant, but must jump from
occupation to amusement, and from amusement back
again to occupation. He must try to make the day as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
long as possible, accustoming himself to do everything
at full speed, and cutting down the hours of sleep as
much as possible. Everybody knows that we moderns,
especially in the great cities, are losing the habit of
sleeping.</p>

<p>We have not yet mentioned, however, the most
serious drawbacks of the present-day lack of any fixed
limit to men’s desires. In the past ages, the efforts of
religion were directed to educating men to self-introspection;
to teaching them to explore their own consciences,
to render account to themselves of their own
sins and vices, and to try to amend them. One might
even go so far as to say that from one point of view
Christianity was principally a melancholy meditation
on the perversity of human nature, and an effort to
purify it through meditation, suffering, and the love of
God. One has only to read the letters of Saint Catherine,
or the <i>Divine Comedy</i>, or Pascal’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pensées</i> to realise
to what an extent the moral refinement which is the
fruit of these meditations preoccupied the loftiest minds,
and, at second hand, the great ones of the earth in past
centuries. A considerable part of the energies of every
generation was consumed in this introspective effort,
instead of in action; for centuries and centuries, saints,
moralists, and preachers abounded in Europe, while
men of action, fit to conquer the world and its riches,
nature and her secrets, were scarce.</p>

<p>This searching of the inward parts was not always
soothing by any manner of means. For the past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
century and a half, numerous writers and philosophers
have denounced it as one of the refinements of torture
with which religion in the past made men’s lives a
burden to them. Perhaps, however, they are wrong;
for this effort, which religion made for so many centuries
to habituate man to self-introspection, self-knowledge,
and self-judgment, demands a less superficial explanation.
However great be the force of the laws and the
vigilance of public opinion, there can be no convenient
order in a social system, if man does not help by exercising
some sort of surveillance over himself, if he does
not give ear to an inward voice, forbidding him to take
advantage of every opportunity of doing evil with
impunity which may offer itself. This necessity for
self-restraint is particularly urgent in connection with
three duties: the duty of speaking the truth, the duty of
checking one’s own inclination to pleasure, especially
in the relations between the sexes, and the duty of not
using one’s own strength improperly at the expense of
the weak. Many are the times when we could tell a
lie with impunity, or even with advantage to ourselves,
if we wished to do so; and yet it is necessary that we
should speak the truth spontaneously, in order that
justice may triumph. How easy it is for the man who
has become the slave of vice to evade the eyes of his fellows
and to satisfy in secret his most perverse passions!
And what system of laws can be conceived which will be
wise and perfect enough to bar all the countless ways
in which the stronger can impose upon the weaker?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>Every religion with more or less success—and none
with more success than Christianity—in centuries past
helped law and public opinion to regulate this most
important part of morality. They all made a sacred
thing of an oath, which is nothing but a covenant which
every individual enters into with himself to speak
the truth, even when he could lie with impunity or
with advantage to himself. They all created a sexual
morality to regulate love, marriage, and the family.
They endeavoured in various ways to awaken in the
consciences of the rich and powerful the recognition
of certain duties of moderation and charity towards
the weak and the poor. Nowadays, on the contrary,
men no longer have time to examine their consciences,
or to reflect on their own vices and defects, or on their
own duties and rights. The whole atmosphere of our
lives is exterior to ourselves; we are always moving
about and always busy. We have become almost
incapable of meditation and self-introspection. Our
times no longer lay any store by this education of our
inner feelings. The only discipline they impose on
man is that of work. Everybody, whether of high
degree or of low, is required, under penalty of losing his
daily bread or of dropping in the social scale, to fill with
exactness, precision, diligence, and correctness, the rôle,
be it little or big, which has been allotted to him in the
immense operations of our times. But, for the rest,
everyone is to-day much more free than he was in the
past to adjust his line of action to his own beliefs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
to make for himself his own standard and his own laws.</p>

<p>The result is that all the scruples and internal restraints
with which religion endowed the conscience of
man in the past are growing rusty from disuse. Our
civilisation, rich and splendid as it is, threatens to be
spoiled by fraud, by evil habits, and by oppression.
There is no doubt about it; not even in these days is the
discipline of work sufficient in itself to keep the State
in good order. Man is not a living machine, destined
only to produce riches. When he leaves his office and
comes back into the world, the modern man there finds
a family, sons, parents, friends, persons of the other sex
who may attract him, men richer and more powerful
than himself, others weaker and poorer, political institutions
and public problems; in short, opportunities of
doing good or evil, temptations dangerous but agreeable,
and duties painful but necessary. And our times not
only give him practically no moral assistance to conquer
these temptations and to perform these duties, but
rather in many ways incite him to yield to the temptations,
and to exercise his cunning in evading the duties.
Fraud in particular is becoming simply second nature to
our civilisation. What is the great industrial movement
of modern times but a continual deception for cloaking
the deterioration which it is bringing about in the
quality of things as the price of increasing the quantity
of them? Every day sees an increase in the number of
cleverly faked objects, which are not what they seem;
and science—especially chemistry—is the highly paid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
accomplice which furnishes industry with the means of
imposing this colossal deception on an inexperienced
and ingenuous public. In other words, commerce and
industry, which play so large a part in modern life, are
becoming more and more a colossal deception in which
he succeeds best and makes most money who is cleverest
at lying to the public and at foisting on them goods of
inferior quality though superior in outward seeming.
Now if we see in a social system, on the one hand,
a weakening of all the internal restraints which keep a
man from lying and cheating, and, on the other, a premium
put on that same lying and cheating, must we
not expect to find fraud permeating the whole system?
And what will our customs be like, what will life be like,
in the days when nobody any longer feels any remorse
or scruple in cheating his neighbour, and when everybody
becomes cheat and cheated turn and turn about,
cheat in matters which he understands, cheated in those
in which he has to rely on other people?</p>

<p>The growing depravity of customs, furthermore,
threatens us with no less a danger. I do not wish to
exaggerate the horrors of the modern Babylons, as
Catholic priests and Protestant ministers are apt to do.
Their grief at seeing the rising generation turn a deaf
ear to their wise counsels makes them take too gloomy a
view of the present state of affairs. Nevertheless, it is
certain that the customs of modern civilisation are
hurrying it towards a dangerous crisis. The internal
restraints are being relaxed, and temptations and facilities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
are multiplying with the growth of riches and of
cities, and with the increasing mobility of persons of
both sexes, so many of whom it prompts to leave their
native village or country. Especially in the big cities
where everyone is unknown, can easily hide away, and
is watched by nobody; where money has greater power
over men’s minds because there is more of it and more of
it is needed,—virtue runs serious and continual risks.
Without being aware of it, we are undoing, little by
little, Christianity’s great contribution to the chastening
of our customs, by suppressing many of the limits
which Christianity had established with such labour in
the midst of the unbridled licence of the ancient world.
We are travelling, therefore, step by step back towards
paganism, with all its conveniences and all its perils.
Already, in fact, we can see cropping up here and
there in the richer and more highly civilised countries
and classes that mortal sickness which killed the ancient
civilisations: sterility. One of the reasons why all the
most flourishing ancient civilisations have perished is
that at the moment of their greatest glory the population
suddenly began to dwindle; and this sterility which
killed them was the effect to a large extent of the licence
of their customs. Love remains fertile only so long as
it restrains itself and limits itself. Christianity, by
subjecting men’s customs to discipline—one of the
noblest of its services to mankind—succeeded for
centuries in maintaining in Europe and America an
incessant fertility, which has proved to be one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
most potent causes of the increase of our power. But
now we can see, with the return of the world to paganism,
the beginning of a new era of sterility, especially in
the big cities and in the most ancient and most wealthy
states.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have referred to another danger which
threatens this our social system, victim as it is of its
limitless desires; I mean the increase in the opportunities
for the strong to abuse their strength. This is
certainly the least of the three evils; for thanks to the
diffusion of culture and of liberty, the weak have learned
and are able, to unite in their own defence. Some
balance of justice is obtained and will continue to be
obtained by opposing force to force. The balance,
however, will be in external things rather than in men’s
convictions. For in this unbridled and limitless chase
after money and enjoyment, of which the world is the
theatre, the spirit of charity is obscured; and men’s
minds become accustomed to a hardness and brutality
which may perhaps one day startle the world in a disagreeable
and terrible way.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>It may seem to some of my readers that I take a
delight in uttering gloomy prognostications of the future
of modern civilisation. Such, however, is not my intention.
Who would dare to deny that, notwithstanding
its defects, the civilisation in which we have the
good fortune to live is the most splendid and powerful
on which the sun has ever shone? But its very grandeur,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
which is to so large an extent the fruit of our
boldness in overthrowing most of the limits which
preceding civilisations had placed to human energy,
gives birth to a new and formidable problem which is
already beginning to confront our speed-loving civilisation,
and which is itself, too, a problem of limits, perhaps
of the limit <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>. And that problem may be
expressed in one question: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quousque tandem?</i> Up to
what point, in our desire to conquer the world and its
treasures, to multiply riches, and to increase our power
over nature, must we and can we sacrifice beauty, and
the forms, ceremonies, and refinements of life, moral and
æsthetic? Up to what point must we and can we make
legitimate use of the liberty which the modern world has
given us; and at what point does abuse of it begin?</p>

<p>This is the vital problem which I have posed and
tried to dissect in the dialogue which my travels in
America inspired me to write: the problem treated in
the speeches and discussions of the many characters,
European and American, who figure in that dialogue.
It may seem strange, at first sight, that a discussion of
the Old World and the New, in which the contending
parties propose to prove which is superior to the other,
should end in this second problem, apparently so unlike
the first; whether it is necessary or not to place a limit
on the unbridled activity and immoderate desires of our
times. Anyone who has read the present series of
essays, however, will be less likely to find this conclusion
singular and obscure. I have repeatedly said, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
tried to prove, that there is too great a tendency on
both sides of the Atlantic to find an antagonism between
Europe and America. If certain tendencies are stronger
in one of the two continents, and weaker in the other,
these are differences of quantity, not of quality. America
is becoming Europeanised, and Europe Americanised.
However little reflection and cool reasoning the European
may bring to his abuse of America on the score of
its excessive zeal in the production of riches, or the
American to his abuse of Europe on account of the
scanty remains of the spirit of tradition and conservatism
in the Old World, each will recognise that he is at
the same time inveighing against his own continent.
In fact, Europe applies herself with no less zeal than
America to the production of greater wealth; and
America is no less anxious than Europe to enjoy the
advantages which may even now accrue to the world
from the spirit of tradition.</p>

<p>Consequently the discussion of the question whether
America is superior to Europe or Europe to America is
a futile enterprise and labour lost; because the balance
between the differences is rapidly adjusting itself.
Nevertheless, if any difference exists to-day between the
two continents, it is undoubtedly this: that all the
phenomena of social life in America are simpler and
clearer, and less overlaid and obscured by traditions,
institutions, and century-old ideas and sentiments than
in Europe. For this reason, the careful observer will
find in America a much more profitable field for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
study of the dangerous tendencies and exaggerations of
modern civilisation which are common to Europe and
America. Of these dangerous tendencies, the one which
has struck me most in the course of my travels in
America, and has given me most food for thought, is
precisely this, which I have treated in this my latest
work and which forms, as it were, the crown to the
whole discussion of the dialogue. Modern civilisation
has accomplished miracles and marvels without number,
since she left behind her the limits, material and
ideal, within which the timid generations of old confined
themselves,—since she outstepped and upset these
limits on her way to conquer the earth, riches, and
liberty. Now, however, precisely because she has
crossed all the limits and no longer has any before her,
she finds herself impelled on every side, in politics,
customs, morals, art, and philosophy, to excesses which
may one day prove very dangerous. Men are beginning
to have a vague presentiment of this danger. They do
not clearly see, however, the quarter from which it
threatens. They disquiet themselves without thoroughly
diagnosing the evil. And this disquietude may
perhaps explain the pessimism which afflicts a civilisation
so flourishing and fortunate in many respects as
that of our own times.</p>

<p>For this reason, I thought that the great problem of
the limits might grow little by little, on board a transatlantic
liner, out of a discussion about America. An
Italian, who has made money in America, and who, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
so many Europeans who have made their fortune thus,
is an admirer of the New World, one evening launches
out into a eulogy of young America at the expense of
old Europe. He extols the civilisation of machinery,
progress, and liberty, by contrast with what remains in
Europe of the ancient civilisation whose efforts were
directed to improving the quality of things rather than
augmenting their quantity; which left the world poor
while it created arts, religions, moralities, and rights.
The discussion becomes heated, complicated, and diffuse
until, under the guiding influence of an old savant who
knows Europe and America too, it concentrates on this
point: Granted that man was well-advised to exceed
the ancient limits within which preceding civilisations
had confined him, to hurl himself on the world and to
conquer it; up to what point may man aspire to liberty
in every department of life, without endangering in the
long run the most precious fruits of his conquest?</p>

<p>The book does not pretend to solve this formidable
problem. No philosopher, no writer, no book could
solve it. It can only be solved by a radical revolution
in the ideas, sentiments, and interests of the masses.
But the book which I have written purports to throw
light on some, at least, of the essential aspects of the
problem. It endeavours to make it clear to the men of
our time, by harping on a principle of great antiquity,
great simplicity, and great modesty, which may be
perhaps usefully recalled to the memory of present
generations, in Europe as well as in America. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
principle is, that man is a being of limits; and that he
ought, therefore, to observe in his desires a certain mean.
A civilisation must remember that it is the sum of the
efforts of a great many individuals; that these individuals
may be very numerous, but that each one is a
small limited being; and that the sum of their efforts
cannot be infinite. Consequently, a civilisation must
not let its desires and wishes extend untrammelled in
every direction. It must learn to confine itself within
limits.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RIDDLE OF AMERICA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> Argentina, there are vast and luxuriant valleys,
over which the train seems to creep toward the very
edge of a horizon which ever recedes as the traveller
advances. From time to time, four or five red one-storied
houses, clustered behind a station, recall to his
mind the fact that this wilderness is actually inhabited.
In Brazil, so far as the eye can see, there are ranges of
mountains, shadowy even in brilliant daylight, in the
midst of which, from time to time, one mountain stands
out more distinctly than its fellows. The shadowy hills
are those still covered by the primeval forest; the others,
those where the timber has been burned off and replaced
by coffee plantations; but even here there is no trace of
human life. One must travel long hours by railroad
before even catching sight of a village.</p>

<p>In North America, or at least in its Eastern States,
there are vast and desolate tracts. From time to time
a village appears, bristling with chimneys. Then the
traveller slips on into the deserted country. Another
village appears, only in its turn to disappear. Then all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
at once the train begins to rush through the midst of
houses. On, on it goes. The houses never cease to
follow it. Huge edifices rise from the midst of the little
dwellings like giants from a crowd of dwarfs. Automobiles
and trolley cars move through the streets. It
is a great city; half a million, a million, two million men
are crowded together there in the shadow of a thousand
chimneys, surrounded on every side by an almost
deserted country. What a strange sight are these
wildernesses to a European accustomed to live in one of
the crowded countries of the Old World where men have
built their houses everywhere, from the shores of the
sea up to the highest habitable slopes of the mountains!</p>

<p>In observing a phenomenon so novel to his experience,
the historian of antiquity is deeply interested; and as he
studies it, like so many other Europeans in the presence
of the same spectacle, he forgets his own preoccupations.
The riddle of America rises before him and the desire
of finding an answer to it turns him from his former
studies. For America is a true riddle to Europeans.
During the past thirty years, not only the United
States, but even smaller American countries like Brazil
and Argentina, have impressed themselves sharply upon
the attention of Europe. The Old World has been
compelled to recognise that America has in her turn
become a mighty historic force; and that she exercises
an influence on the Old World which grows continuously
greater. When one reflects that, only a century and a
half ago, all these American states were merely poverty-stricken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
colonies of Europe, harshly exploited by their
European masters, one cannot suppress amazement at
the rapidity with which their destiny has changed.</p>

<p>What power is it which has worked this miracle?
On this point, it is impossible to feel any doubt; the
power is wealth. These plains and these mountains
which look so deserted are tilled, mined, worked with
intensest energy; and every year, with a generosity
which seems inexhaustible, they yield to the men who
have toiled over them prodigious quantities of cereals,
tobacco, coffee, wool, gold, silver, iron, oil—an enormous
torrent of riches which pours over the entire
world. The great industrial cities of North America
manufacture these raw materials with profits so large
and swiftly won that to the Old World they seem fantastic.
In these plains, in these valleys, in these mountains,
in these cities, labourers receive higher wages,
merchants and manufacturers make their fortunes
faster, capitalists come into contact with mightier
interests, landlords draw higher rents from this prosperity—all
the sources of profit are more abundant
than in Europe. And these conditions have made it
possible for a few of Fortune’s favourites to pile up in
the course of a single lifetime wealth whose vastness
makes the brain swim. America has, in fact, succeeded
in producing riches at a rate of speed that man has never
yet attained elsewhere in the world. She has been the
principal factor in the fabulous increase of the world’s
wealth during the last fifty years. Her riches have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
become one of the historic forces of our civilisation, and
one of the principal preoccupations of the European
mind.</p>

<p>Whence come these vast riches and whither do they
go? How is it that America can grow rich so much
faster than Europe? Is it thanks to far more fortunate
physical conditions, which bear no relation to the deserts
of man? Or is it in consequence of moral and intellectual
qualities which are lacking in Europeans? And
what will be the ultimate effect of this economic superiority?
Riches may be the goal of an individual’s
efforts; for a nation they can only be means to conquer
the other good things of life which we call civilisation:
glory, grandeur, power, beauty, knowledge, moral
refinement. Can America, and will she, make use of
her riches to rob Europe of the intellectual and moral
leadership which the latter still possesses? Or will these
riches, too swiftly won, exercise an evil influence simultaneously
upon Europe and America, by making both
continents more materialistic?</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Such is the riddle of America, which, for some time
past, has been steadily forcing itself upon the attention of
Europe. To arrive at an answer, we must know whether
the influence of a too swift economic development of
the New World upon the higher activities of the mind,
upon morals, upon science, art, and religion is beneficial
or the reverse. The detractors of America—and there
are many of them in Europe—affirm without hesitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
that the Americans are barbarians laden with gold; that
they think only of making money, and that, in consequence
of their riches, they lower the level of Europe’s
ancient civilisation and infect its beautiful traditions
with a crass materialism. Admirers of America, on
the contrary—and of these there are as many in Europe
as there are detractors—will tell you that the New
World is giving to the Old a unique example of energy,
activity, intelligence, and daring. Let old Europe then
give heed; beyond the Atlantic, young rivals are girding
themselves with new weapons to dispute with her the
superiority of which she is proud. What must one
think of these conflicting answers to the puzzle?</p>

<p>Let us begin with the reasoning of the detractors:
“Americans are barbarians laden with gold.” In order
to simplify the discussion, let us limit our examination
to the United States, which is justly entitled to represent
contemporary America with all its qualities and
all its defects. No long sojourn within the borders of
the United States is necessary to convince a person that
in the great Republic people think only of making
money. A writer partial to paradox might well amuse
himself with proving that the Americans are more
idealistic than the Europeans, or even that they are a
mystical people. Anyone who cares to find arguments
to establish this thesis may well be embarrassed by
their number. For instance, would a people which despised
the higher activities of the mind have been able
to create the philosophical doctrine which is popularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
known to us under the name of “Pragmatism”? The
Pragmatist affirms that all ideas capable of rendering
useful service are true. He takes utility as his standard
of the measure of truth. This theory has seemed to
many writers of the Old World a decisive proof of the
practical mind of the American people, who never forget
their material interests, even in connection with metaphysical
questions. This, however, is a mistake.
Pragmatism does not propose to subordinate the ideal to
practical interest. Its purpose is to reconcile opposing
doctrines by proving that all ideas, even those which
seem mutually exclusive, can help us to become wiser,
stronger, better. What service is there then in struggling
to make one idea triumph over another instead of
allowing men to draw from each idea the good which
each can yield? In a word, Pragmatism, as America
has conceived it, is a mighty effort to give the right of
expression in modern civilisation to all religious and
philosophical doctrines which in the past have stained
the world with their sanguinary struggles.</p>

<p>A beautiful doctrine this, which may lend itself to
many objections; but true or false, it proves that the
people who have conceived it, far from despising the
ideal, have such respect for all ideas and all beliefs, that
they have not the courage to repel a single one. Such
a people wishes to learn all and understand all.</p>

<p>Another proof of this same characteristic is furnished
by American universities. Europeans have all heard
descriptions of these great American universities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
Harvard and Columbia, for example. They are true
cities of learning with vast and splendid buildings,
gardens, pavilions, laboratories, museums, libraries,
athletic fields for physical exercises, pools where
students can go to swim. They are enormously rich
and, at the same time, always in dire straits. How can
that be? Because no speciality or item of perfection is
allowed to be lacking. All the languages and the
literatures of the world which have reached any degree of
importance, all the histories, all the sciences,—judicial,
social, moral, physical, natural,—all the divisions of
mathematics, and all the philosophies, are taught there
by hundreds of professors. Private citizens of the rich
classes, bankers, manufacturers, merchants, have in a
great degree met from their private purses the steadily
growing needs of the universities.</p>

<p>There is the same tendency in art. That American
cities are ugly, I willingly admit. It would need much
courage, no doubt, to brand this affirmation as false,
but it would also be unjust to deny that America is
making mighty efforts to beautify her cities. All the
schools of architecture in Europe, especially that of
Paris, are full of Americans hard at work. The sums
which cities, states, banks, insurance companies,
universities, and railroads, have spent in beautifying
their magnificent edifices is fabulous. Not all these
buildings, by any means, are masterpieces, but there are
many which are very beautiful. America has architects
of indisputable worth. In Europe, men like to repeat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
that Americans buy at extravagant prices objects of
ancient art, or things that pass for such, not distinguishing
those which are beautiful and ancient from
those which are inferior and counterfeit. But those who
have seen something of the houses of rich Americans
know that, although there are snobs and dupes in
America, as everywhere else, there are also people who
know the meaning of art, who know how to buy beautiful
things, and who search the world over for them. You
will find in the streets of New York every variety of
architecture, just as you find in its libraries all the
literatures of the world, and in its theatres all the music,
and in its houses all the decorative arts.</p>

<p>“The barbarian laden with gold” is, then, a legendary
personage, but it is not at all surprising that such a
conception should exist. Modern society is organised
in such fashion that it is impossible even to conceive of
a people at once rich and ignorant. Industry, business,
agriculture, demand nowadays very special technical
knowledge, and a very complete social organisation;
that is to say, they imply a scientific, political, and
judicial civilisation of a reasonably high order. Thus
America is not at all uninterested in the higher activities
of the mind. It would be more just to say that as
a nation, and without regard to individual instances, she
interests herself in such activities less than in industry,
in business, and in agriculture. But is not this also the
case with Europe? Who would dare affirm that the
progress of the arts and sciences and letters is at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
moment the principal concern of the governments and
of the influential classes of the Old World? We Europeans
have only to listen to what people round about
us are saying. Their talk is all of bringing the cultivation
of the land to economic perfection, of opening coal
and iron mines, of harnessing waterfalls, of developing
industries, of increasing exports. Kings who rule “by
the grace of God” publicly declare that nothing interests
them so much as the business of their countries!</p>

<p>If all this were characteristic only of American barbarism,
we should be obliged to admit that Europe is
Americanising herself with disconcerting rapidity. But
this economic effort of Europe in turn presents nothing
that need surprise us; like the American development,
it is only the dizzy acceleration of a vast historic movement
whose beginnings go back to the far distant day
when an obscure and obstinate Genoese set sail, and in
the midst of the waters of the Atlantic crossed the
impassable boundary of the Old World. Yes, before
that day, Europe had created admirable arts and literatures,
profound philosophies, consoling religions, lofty
morals, wise systems of justice, but—she was poor.
She produced little, and produced it slowly; she had
defied tradition and authority; she had fettered human
energy by a multitude of laws, precepts, and prejudices.
To humble men’s pride, she kept repeating to them that
they were feeble and corrupt creatures. She taught
them to use Virgil’s beautiful figure that they were like
“a rower who painfully forces his boat against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
current of the stream. Evil be on his head if for one
instant he forgets, and ceases to struggle against the
current’s force; in that moment, he is lost; the flood
sweeps away his fragile boat.”</p>

<p>One fine day, however, Europe discovered a vast
continent in the midst of the ocean. Then it dawned
upon her that Prometheus had been but a clumsy thief,
for he had stolen only a tiny spark of fire; she discovered
mines, coal, and electricity. She created the steam-engine
and all the other machines which have been
derived from it. She succeeded in multiplying riches
with a rapidity unimagined by remoter ancestors.
From that moment, man no longer contented himself
with dreaming of the Promised Land. He wished to go
there. He destroyed all the traditions, the laws, and
institutions which place limitations upon the store of
human energy. He learned to work swiftly. At a
single stroke, he conquered liberty and riches, and he
conceived the idea of progress. If America seems to-day
to symbolise this movement, which has turned the
world topsy-turvy, the movement was derived from
Europe. After having conceived the idea of such a
revolution, could Europe remain untouched by it?</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>It would appear then that the riddle of America is
very simple. The answer contains nothing to make us
uneasy. The riches of the New World threaten no
catastrophe to the noblest traditions of our civilisation.
For New York’s wealth is only a part of the riches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
produced in the same economic development in the
two worlds. The ultimate development of these
mighty riches might be merely a general advance, both
material and ideal, of Europe and America. Rich and
prosperous Americans might try to assimilate the culture
of Europe, and on her part Europe, in her effort to
increase her own riches, might seek to equal America.
But a historian of antiquity who returns from America
cannot share this optimism. In the lap of modern
civilisation, there are twin worlds struggling with each
other for leadership. But these two worlds are not, as
people are apt to think, Europe and America. Their
names are Quality and Quantity.</p>

<p>The civilisations from which our own is sprung were
poor indeed. They set limits to their desires, their
ambitions, their spirit of initiative, their audacity, their
originality. They brought forth slowly and a little at a
time, and suffered continuously from the insufficiency
of their material resources. They looked upon the
amassing of wealth merely as a painful necessity; but,
in all things, they sought to attain the difficult model of
perfection, whether in art, or in literature, or in the
realms of morality and religion. The aristocratic
character of almost all the industries of the past, the
importance which was formerly bestowed on the decorative
arts and on all questions of personal morality,
ceremonial, and form—these are all proofs of it. It was
Quality, not Quantity, which carried our forefathers
forward. All the limitations to which these civilisations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
were subject, so astonishing to us to-day, were only the
necessary cost of these perfections which men once so
ardently desired. We have turned upside down the
world our ancestors lived in. We have made our goal
the multiplication of riches. We have won liberty,
but we have been obliged to abandon almost all the
ancient ideals of perfection, sacrificing Quality in
everything.</p>

<p>How many of the difficulties which torture this
brilliant period of ours so cruelly are the result of this
duel between Quality and Quantity! Look, for example,
at the present crisis in the study of the classics. Why
did men formerly study Homer and Cicero with passionate
zeal? Because, in those days, the great Greek and
Latin writers were the models of that literary perfection,
so greatly admired by the influential classes, which was
not merely an ornament of the mind. The attainment
of perfection often carried with it the admiration of the
public, fame, sometimes even glory and high rank.
In this last century, however, these models have lost
much of their prestige, either on account of the multitude
of literatures which have come to be known and
liked, or because they have proved troublesome to a
period compelled to write too much and too quickly.
Just imagine a candidate for the presidency of the
United States who should pronounce ten or fifteen long
orations daily and who should in each discourse show
himself the perfect orator according to the rules of
Cicero or Quintilian! The day when classical culture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
ceased to be an official school of literary taste, on that
day it was condemned to die; and scientific philology,
which we have sought to set up in its place, can only
serve to bury its corpse. No longer models for posterity,
the books of the ancient authors have become
like any others, and are less interesting for
the majority of readers than the works of modern
literatures.</p>

<p>It is the fashion nowadays to discuss the crisis which
threatens all the arts. We must, however, remember to
preserve a distinction. We must divide the arts into
two categories: those which serve to amuse men by
helping them to pass the time agreeably, like music,
the theatre, and, to a certain degree, literature; and
those which serve to beautify the world, like architecture,
sculpture, painting, and all the decorative arts.
It is patent that the crisis which we are considering is
much more serious among the arts embraced by the
second category. No epoch has spent so much money
in beautifying the world as has our own; no age has
supported so formidable an army of architects, sculptors,
decorators, and cabinet-makers; no age has built
so many cities, palaces, monuments, bridges, plazas,
and gardens. In the midst of lavish plenty, why are
we so discontented with the results obtained; why have
not Americans, in view of the enormous sums which
they have spent to beautify their cities, succeeded in
building a St. Mark’s or a Notre Dame? They have all
the materials,—money, artists, the desire to create<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
beautiful things. What then do they lack? They
lack one single thing—time.</p>

<p>One day, in New York, I was praising an example
of American architecture to an American architect of
great talent. “Yes, yes,” he answered with a touch
of satire, “my fellow countrymen would willingly spend
a hundred million dollars to build a church as beautiful
as St. Mark’s in Venice, but they would command
me, as a condition of my undertaking the work, to
finish it within eighteen months.”</p>

<p>That is a significant phrase. How is it possible to
beautify a world which is incessantly in transformation,
wherein nothing is stable, and which wishes to multiply
everything it possesses—buildings, as it would furniture?
To create beautiful palaces, to construct beautiful
furniture, to attain the distant ideal of perfection,
time is essential—time and wise deliberation, reasonable
limitation of the multiplicity of human demands,
and a certain stability in taste. No one could have
built St. Mark’s or Notre Dame in eighteen months,
and France could not have created her famous decorative
styles of the eighteenth century if public taste had
been so fickle as ours, and if everybody at that time
had wished every ten years to change his furniture.</p>

<p>The crises in classical studies and in the decorative
arts are, however, still relatively slight in comparison
with the general intellectual and moral confusion into
which the doctrine of Quantity has plunged men’s
minds, by substituting a standard of Quantity in place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
of the traditional standard of Quality. If my phrase is
obscure, examples may possibly elucidate what I say.
We all know, for instance, that, in recent years, the citizens
of the United States have waged a bitter campaign
against the trusts, the great banks, the railroads, and
insurance companies; in fact, against all the vast powers
of money. In newspaper articles, in public speeches,
and in whole volumes filled with accusations, these trusts
have been charged with being centres of corruption,
instruments of a new despotism not less odious than the
political despotism of old. They are decried as scandalous
conspiracies to despoil honest men of the legitimate
fruits of their labour. The campaign has
penetrated to the very heart of the nation; but in the
face of the enormous indignation of the masses, there
has been exhibited both in America and Europe the
Olympian calm of economists and men of great affairs,
who have denounced this movement of protest as a return
to Mediæval ideas, and who in the face of a vast
outcry have paid enthusiastic homage to modern
finance, its enormous enterprises, and its tremendous
organisation.</p>

<p>How can there be so vast a difference of opinion in
an age so intelligent and educated as ours? Is half the
world struck blind to-day, and is sight given to the
other half alone? No, there is neither incurable blindness,
nor sight vouchsafed only to a few. The sole
reason for the confusion is that men employ different
standards in measuring the same thing, and for this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
reason find it impossible to understand each other. If
one accepts the quantitative standard, if one admits
that the supreme object of life is to produce an enormous
pile of riches as rapidly as possible, the economists
are right. The injustices and cruelties denounced by
the adversaries of high finance are merely negligible
inconveniences in a régime of economic liberty of which
the modern world is naturally proud, for it is to this
liberty that the modern world owes most of its wealth.
Yet we must remember that the idea of leaving the
wages of each individual to be determined by the
blind play of economic forces was foreign to all the
civilisations that preceded our own. They always
sought to correct the principles of business in order to
keep them in accord with the principles of charity and
justice. To carry out this policy, they did not even
hesitate to limit the development of industry and
business, for example, by forbidding interest on money.
Former ages subordinated economic development to an
ideal of moral perfection; they placed Quality above
Quantity. If, however, one applies this standard of
qualitative measure to the modern world, it is these
detractors of high finance who have the right on their
side. Many methods employed by modern finance,
useful as they are from an economic point of view, are
for the above-mentioned reason none the less repugnant
to a moral and slightly sensitive conscience. Detractors
and defenders may dispute to the end of time.
They will never understand each other, for they start<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
from different premises, which never can be reconciled
to each other.</p>

<p>It is this continual confusion between quantitative
and qualitative standards which prevents the modern
world from steering a true course amid the gravest
moral questions. Take, for example, the question of
progress. Is there an idea more popular to-day, or a
word more often repeated, than “progress”? And yet
if to every person who pronounces this word we were to
put the question, “What do you mean by progress?”
few indeed would be able to answer with precision.
There is a thing still stranger. In this century of
progress, the whole world deplores ten times a day the
decadence of all things. How can such a contradiction
be explained? The answer is simply that the same act
may be judged as a phenomenon of progress or of
decadence, according as it is viewed from the standpoint
of Quality or of Quantity. Set an architect and a
locomotive builder to disputing about the modern
world. The former will maintain that the world is
reverting to barbarism because it multiplies cities, and
hastily and hideously constructed villages without
being able to create a single one of those marvellous
monuments which are the glory of the Middle Ages.
The latter will reply that the world moves forward,
because the population, number, and size of the cities,
the amount of cultivated land, the extension of railroads,
increase without cessation. The interlocutors
will never come to understand each other, just as two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
men who look at the world through spectacles of different
colours can never agree on the colour of their environment.
The riddle of America, which for some time
past has bothered Europe so much, is merely another
example of this permanent confusion of standards which
characterises the age in which we live.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>America is neither the monstrous country where men
think solely of making money, nor the country of marvels
boasted by her admirers. It is the country where
the principles of Quantity, which have become so
powerful during the last one hundred and fifty years,
have achieved their most extraordinary triumph. An
active, energetic, vigorous nation has found itself
master of an enormous territory, portions of which were
very fertile and other portions very rich in mines and
forests, at the very moment when our civilisation finally
invented the machine which makes possible the exploitation
of vast countries and the swift creation of
wealth: the steam-engine.</p>

<p>Less cumbered by old traditions than the elder
nations, and with a vast continent in front of her,
America has marched along the new roads of history
with a rapidity and an energy for which there is no
precedent. Ten, fifteen, thirty times in a single century
has she multiplied her population, her cities, and
all the wealth coveted by man. She has created, in
careless and prodigal profusion, a society which has
subordinated all former ideas of perfection to a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
ideal; ever building on a grander scale and ever building
more swiftly. No, it is not true that America is indifferent
to the higher activities of mind, but the effort
which she spends upon the arts and sciences is, and will
long remain, subordinate to the great historic task of
the United States, the intensive cultivation of a huge
continent. Intellectual things will remain subordinate,
although very many Americans of the upper classes
would wish that it were otherwise.</p>

<p>In just the same way, it is not accurate to say that,
in contrast to American barbarism, Europe reaps the
harvest of civilisation; just as it would be unfair to say
that the Old World is done for, exhausted by its petrifying,
inevitable routine. The ancient societies of Europe
have likewise entered into the quantitative phase of
civilisation. The new demon has also got hold of them.
In Europe, as well as in America, the masses of people
long for a more comfortable existence; public and private
expenses pile up with bewildering speed. Thus
in the Old World also the production of wealth must be
increased, but this enterprise is far more difficult in
Europe than in America. The population of Europe is
much more dense than that of the New World; a portion
of its lands is exhausted; the great number of political
subdivisions and the multiplicity of tongues increase
enormously the difficulties of conducting business on a
great scale. Traditions handed down from the time
when men toiled to produce slowly and in small quantities
things shaped toward a far-distant ideal of perfection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
are still strong among its people. Europe, then,
has the advantage over America in the higher activities
of the mind, but she cannot help being more timid,
more sluggish, and more limited in her economic
enterprises. America and Europe may each be judged
superior or inferior to the other according as the critic
takes for his standard the criteria of Quality or of
Quantity. If a civilisation approximates perfection in
proportion to the rapidity with which she produced
riches, America is the model to be followed; if, on the
contrary, perfection is expressed by the measure of the
higher activities of the spirit, Europe leads the way.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The riddle, then, seems solved, but the reader may
object that it is solved only by admitting that we dwell
in a perpetual condition of misunderstanding; that the
modern world is a sort of Tower of Babel where men
speak a tongue which others cannot understand. If
this agreeable news were the only thing brought back
by the historian of antiquity from his two voyages to
America, he might better perhaps have spared himself
the trouble! Such might well be the conclusion of this
long argument! Nevertheless, it is indisputable that
the modern world demands two contradictory things,
speed and perfection. We wish to conquer the earth
and its treasures with all possible haste. To this end,
we have created tremendous machinery and have
uncovered new forces in nature. It is a huge task, no
doubt, but to accomplish it we must renounce almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
all the artistic and moral perfections which used to be
at once the torment and joy and pride of our forefathers.
It is a painful necessity indeed, against which our age
revolts, and from which it seeks in vain every possible
channel of escape.</p>

<p>Let us strip off the last shred of illusion. Deterioration
must ever continue amongst the ideals of perfection
which our ancestors worshipped, so long as population
multiplies and the demands and aspirations of all
classes, as well as all expenses, public and private,
continue to increase on the scale and with the momentum
with which they are increasing at this moment.
Even if this formidable revolution should slacken a
trifle, the ideal of Quantity must spread its empire over
the earth, morality and beauty must of necessity be
subordinated to the prime necessities of constructing
machines ever increasing in speed and power, of expanding
cultivated land, and of working new mines. Art,
like industry, agriculture, like literature, will be compelled
to increase their production to the continuous
deterioration of their quality, and our secret discontent
will grow in proportion as our triumphs increase. Unable
ourselves to decide between Quality and Quantity,
we shall never know whether the great drama of the
world at which we are looking is a marvellous epoch of
progress or a melancholy tragedy of decadence.</p>

<p>From this singular situation, there is only one possible
way of escape; a method which has no precedent in
the world’s history. It is that very method, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
which men will not hear spoken of. It would be absolutely
essential to create a movement of public opinion
through religious, political, or moral means, which
should impose upon the world a reasonable limit to its
desires. To the age in which we live, it seems impossible
to express an idea seemingly more absurd than this.
The material situation of every one of us is to-day
bound up with this formidable movement, which drives
men ceaselessly to increase the making and spending of
wealth. Think what an economic crisis there would be
if this movement were to slow down. All the moral
systems which governed the world down to the French
Revolution forced upon men the belief that they would
grow more perfect as they grew simpler. When religion
and custom were not sufficient to teach men to set
limits to their needs and desires, then these old moral
systems had recourse to sumptuary laws. In direct
contrast to this, the nineteenth century affirms that
man grows more perfect in proportion as he produces
and consumes. So confusing are the definitions of
legitimate desires and vices, of reasonable expenses and
inordinate luxury, that in this century it is almost
impossible to differentiate between the one and the
other.</p>

<p>A vast revolution has been brought into being, the
greatest, perhaps, which history can show; but if the
new principles which our century has borne to the front
should be developed until they insured the ultimate and
supreme triumph of Quantity, would it be possible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
escape what would amount to the demolition of the
whole fabric of the glorious civilisation bequeathed to
us by the centuries; religious doctrines and the principles
upon which morality is based, as well as all the
traditions of the arts?</p>

<p>History knows better than do we the dusky roads of
the future, and it is idle for us to wish to see the way
along them; but in spite of our ignorance of the future,
we have duties toward the past and toward ourselves,
and is it not one of these duties to call the attention of
our generation to the possibility of this catastrophe,
even if our generation likes to turn its face away from
it? Very often during my travels in America, I used
to ask myself whether men of various intellectual interests
might not find in this duty something to strengthen
their conscience for the part which they must play in
the world.</p>

<p>If we except medicine, which aims to cure our bodily
ills, those sciences which are concerned with discoveries
useful to industry, and those arts which entertain the
public, all other branches of intellectual activity are
to-day in dire confusion. Is there a pious clergyman
who has not asked himself in moments of discouragement
what good it is to preach the virtues of the Christian
faith in a century whose dynamic power springs
from an exaltation of pride and an emancipation of
passion which amount almost to delirium? What
intelligent historian is there who does not now and then
ask himself why he persists in telling over again the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
events of the past to a generation which no longer looks
ahead, and which rushes violently on the future, head
down like a bull? What philosopher is there who, as
he pursues his transcendental preoccupation, does not
feel himself sometimes hopelessly adrift, like a being
fallen upon the earth, from another planet, in an age
which no longer is passionately interested in anything
except economic reality? What artist is there who
seeks not only to make money, but to reach the perfection
of his ideal, who has not cursed a thousand times
this frenzied hurly-burly in the midst of which we live?</p>

<p>From time to time, it is true, there seems to be a
genuine revival of the ancient ideal; men suddenly
appear who seem to interest themselves afresh in the
progress of religion, in the future of morality, in the
history of the past, in the problems of metaphysics, in
the artistic records of civilisation long since dead.
These are, however, only passing phenomena, and they
are not enduring enough to give artists and philosophers
the definite consciousness of playing a well-thought-out
and useful part.</p>

<p>If all intellectual activities of to-day tend to become
either lucrative professions or government careers; it is
because nowadays such careers aim either at the acquisition
of money or the attainment of social position, and
no longer find their end in the careers themselves.
And yet—how many times as he travelled across the
territory of the two Americas, watching all day fields
of wheat and rye, or plantations of maize or coffee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
extending to the very edge of the solitary horizon, how
many times has the historian of antiquity brooded over
those fragments of marble wrought by the Greeks in
such perfection, which we admire in our museums, and
pondered upon the fragments of the great Roman
system of jurisprudence preserved in the “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corpus
juris</i>.” Did not the Greeks and Romans succeed in
reaching this marvellous perfection in the arts and laws
because there came a time when they were willing to
cease extending the limits of their empire over the earth
and all the treasures it contains? Have we not conquered
vast deserts with our railroads just because we
have been able to renounce almost all the artistic and
moral perfections which were the glory of the ancients?</p>

<p>In the light of this idea, the historian felt that he had
come to understand all the better ancient civilisation
and our own, and that his eyes were able to pierce more
deeply into the shadowy depths of human destiny. A
civilisation which pursues its desire for perfection
beyond a certain limit ends by exhausting its energy in
the pursuit of an object at once too narrow and impossible
of attainment. On the other hand, a civilisation
which allows itself to be intoxicated by the madness
of mere size, by speed, by quantity, is destined to end
in a new type of crass and violent barbarism. But the
point where these two opposing forces of life find their
most perfect equilibrium changes continually from age
to age; and any epoch approaches more or less near this
point according to the degree of activity of the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
forces struggling within it. The artist, the priest, the
historian, the philosopher, in moments of discouragement,
when they feel themselves assailed by the temptation
to think only of a career or of money, may well
find new strength in the idea that each of them is working
in his different way to preserve an ideal of perfection
in men’s souls—it may be a perfection of art or of
morality, of the intellect or of the spirit. Let them
remember that this ideal, limited as it may seem, serves
as a dike to prevent our civilisation from being engulfed
in an overwhelming flood of riches and from
sinking in an orgy of brutality. This task is so great
and so noble that those who strive for it ought surely to
feel that they do not live in vain.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRIAL OF VERRES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the early days of the year 70 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, a deputation
from the cities of Sicily arrived at Rome and
sought an interview with a young Senator, who was already
famed for his eloquence, by name Marcus Tullius
Cicero. What could be the object of the Sicilians’
visit to Rome and to the modest house of the young
Senator, whose strict probity and modest means made it
impossible for him to receive his visitors in a sumptuous
palace? Justice was the object of their visit. For
three years, from 75 to 73 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Sicily had been governed
by a young pro-prætor, a scion of an illustrious house,
who had powerful friends amongst the party in power:
Caius Cornelius Verres. Daring, imprudent, covetous,
fond of art and its products and of the pleasures of life,
emboldened by a rapid and fortunate career, the
young pro-prætor had certainly much abused his
power in the provinces and had too readily turned to
account the corrupt notions of the times in the amassing
of a huge fortune by all the means, licit and illicit, which
a pro-prætor could use and abuse, though in doing so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
he had offended the interests and susceptibilities of
others, and had made a great number of enemies. That
is the only conclusion to be drawn from the fact that,
after his departure, the cities, accustomed though they
were to insolent and overbearing governors, decided
in this instance to present an indictment and had
recourse to the young Senator who five years before
had been quæstor in Sicily, and who had left behind
him in the island a great reputation for culture, generosity
and honesty. When he left the island, this young
Senator had himself said to the Sicilians in a speech
delivered at Lilybæum: “If at any time you have
need of me, come and fetch me.”</p>

<p>The Sicilians had remembered this promise. The
laws of ancient Rome allowed any citizen to cite in the
courts any other citizen whom he suspected of having
broken the laws. Would Cicero cite Verres in Sicily’s
behalf? The proposal of the Sicilian cities was a proof
of remarkable confidence, but it was at the same time
a dangerous honour. Verres was a rich man; he was
powerful and had any number of helpers and supporters
among the party in power. Of even greater assistance
to Verres than the friendship of the influential was the
feeling of community of interest amongst the dominant
faction. This faction was the faction of Sulla, that is
to say, the more conservative portion of the nobility,
which, after a terrible civil war waged against the
Democratic party, had succeeded in seizing the reins
of government of the Republic. It was a faction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
composed of widely differing ingredients. It comprised
not a few honourable and upright men, who would
naturally wish the provinces to be governed humanely
and uprightly. But great though the desire might be
that the Empire should be governed well, still greater
was the desire to preserve, together with the constitution
imposed by Sulla on the Empire, the power bequeathed
by him. At this juncture, the opposite party
had been conquered but not destroyed, and its survivors
were restlessly alert for every opportunity of injuring
the dominant faction with all the arms provided by the
constitution, amongst which one of the most dangerous
was precisely the initiation of scandalous charges
against prominent persons. Consequently, legal proceedings
and scandals intended to discredit the State
had, since Sulla’s time, been looked on with much
disfavour by the dominant party, even honourable
members of which, faced with the choice between the
harm which one of these processes caused to the party
and to the authority of the State and the injury to
justice resulting from the escape of a powerful culprit
unpunished, nearly always preferred the second.</p>

<p>In fact, for years past, the dominant party had
strained every nerve to prevent these processes, thus
encouraging the less honourable governors to abuse
their authority. The result had been the rise in the
public conscience of a feeling of uneasiness, discontent,
and irritation, which the stories, often exaggerated, of
the cruelty and violence of the governors served only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
to accentuate. And by none at that moment was this
uneasiness more acutely felt than by Cicero. Cicero
belonged to a family of equestrian rank—middle-class
we should call it—from Arpino. He was a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">homo novus</i>,
a self-made man, to use a modern expression, because
he was the first of the family to become a member of
the Senate. He was not very rich and, though a man
of intelligence and vigour, he was somewhat lacking
in courage. Consequently, he was not the man to
dare open defiance of the wrath, or a frontal attack
on the interests, of the dominant caste; rather were
these violent and terrible accusations so repugnant to
his nature that he had never brought himself hitherto
to assume the rôle of prosecutor in any action. He had
always preferred the more humane part of defender.
He was, however, an honourable man, with small
affection—like all the equestrian order—for the faction
and government formed by Sulla; and he was fully
conscious of the obligation imposed on him by the
promise which he had made so solemnly to the Sicilians.
Besides, he was young—only thirty-six years old—and
was still a man of secondary importance. A case of
great public interest, which set all Italy talking, and
in which he was the popular protagonist, might be of
great service to his lofty and legitimate ambitions. In
addition, things had been moving fast recently, to the
detriment of the party in power, who were accused on
all sides of outrage and corruption. The consuls for
that year were Pompey and Crassus, who, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
members of the Sullan party, had come forward as
candidates with a Democratic programme, promising
no less than that they would restore to the tribunes of
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">plebs</i> those powers of which Sulla had stripped
them. There was a feeling in the air which seemed to
promise that just for once the infamies of a governor
might receive condign punishment from outraged
public opinion.</p>

<p>The young advocate realised that the decisive moment
of his life had come. He agreed to prosecute Verres.
But what crime or crimes should he lay to his charge?
At this point emerges the first strange feature in the
history of this strange case. The budget of charges,
recriminations, and denunciations against Verres,
which the Sicilians lodged with Cicero, comprised
enough and to spare of crimes of every sort, some of
which were actually of a capital nature. For instance,
Verres was accused of having ordered Roman citizens
to execution—which was a capital offence. But what
did Cicero do? He carefully singled out the least
serious charge and persuaded the Sicilians to lay an
indictment <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de pecuniis repetundis</i>—to demand, that
is to say, that Verres should be condemned to pay one
hundred million <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">prezzi</i> (twenty-five million francs)
as a penalty for having levied unauthorised taxes.
How are we to explain this forbearance? Cicero in his
speeches against Verres denounces him as a monster
and a wild beast. He launches the most terrible
invectives against his villainies. There is no need,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
however, to interpret too literally his glowing periods.
Not even Cicero could forget, while he was accusing
Verres, that he himself and the man he was accusing
belonged to the same class, and were members
of the same aristocracy, which controlled the vast
Roman Empire. However keen might be the indignation
aroused by the misdeeds of Verres, not even
the strictest section of the aristocracy would have
approved too relentless a line of attack, or one which
involved the accused in too serious danger. Personal
hatred was a less powerful factor than the sentiment of
caste and the interest each man felt in securing a mitigation
of the severity of the laws in favour of his fellows,
in anticipation of a similar privilege for himself when
occasion might arise. Therefore Cicero acted wisely
in his clients’ interests when he chose that charge
which promised the least danger to the defendant;
for he knew that otherwise the latter would have an
easier task in escaping conviction.</p>

<p>The weakness of the attack, however, as always
happens, emboldened the accused. Verres did not
hesitate one moment to make a political matter of his
case. He had recourse to all the most influential
members of his party. He begged Q. Hortensius, who
was the greatest orator and the cleverest advocate of
the day, to defend him. In every possible way, he
tried to enlist in his support party interests and caste
consciousness. He represented the indictment as a
machination of the Democratic party, of the opposition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
to bring obloquy on the party which had been
restored to power by Sulla. He, Verres, was the victim,
in whose person it was hoped to strike a blow at the
whole of the Conservative aristocracy, and at Sulla’s
life work! This view of the matter was at this juncture
not unconvincing, so that Verres, when he began the
struggle, found himself supported by powerful friends.</p>

<p>His first move had for its object the elimination of
Cicero as prosecutor. The Roman law, though it
allowed anyone to constitute himself accuser of a
citizen who had violated the laws, did not permit an
unlimited number of people to get up and accuse a
single individual. For, in that case, the law would
have worked oppressively, cruelly, and unconscionably.
The accusation had to be lodged by a single person;
and if several persons asked to be allowed to accuse an
individual, it was the duty of the authority to choose
one of them as the accuser. Verres accordingly tried
to find a rival for Cicero. A certain Quintus Cecilius
Negro, a Roman citizen, but of Sicilian origin and a
Hebrew by religion, who had been Verres’s quæstor
in Sicily, appeared before the Prætor, declaring that
he wished to prosecute Verres, and demanding the
privilege over Cicero on the pretext that he had been
insulted by Verres in Sicily. As a matter of fact, there
had been a violent quarrel between them about a
certain Agonis, a freedwoman of the temple of Venus
at Eryx, who practised the profession reserved in the
ancient world for the slaves of the temples of Venus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p>So a preliminary trial was necessary to decide which
should be the accuser, Cecilius or Cicero, and this
trial took place in the early months of the year 70.
Cicero made a powerful speech in which he clearly
insinuated that Cecilius was playing a part with the
connivance of Verres; that the former, if he were
chosen to be the accuser, would conduct the prosecution
in the way best calculated to secure Verres’s
acquittal. He added in more precise terms that the
case was of the greatest political importance, inasmuch
as it was bound to prove definitely to the provinces
whether there was or was not justice to be had in Rome;
whether the subjects of Rome might expect to find
their rights impartially defended in the courts of the
Republic, or whether—as the enemies of Rome and the
adversaries of the dominant party were repeating on
all sides—the aristocracy were nothing but a corrupt
and rapacious association without bowels of mercy
for the victims whom they tortured.</p>

<p>Cicero was successful in this first skirmish. He
obtained recognition from the court as the prosecutor
of Verres, and was granted one hundred and ten days
in which to proceed to Sicily to collect the proofs of
his accusation. He started at once.</p>

<p>At Rome, the struggle between the party with the
purse and the Democratic opposition, encouraged by the
support of the two all-powerful Consuls, waxed furious.
Pompey and Crassus induced the Senate to restore to
the Tribunes their ancient powers. They re-established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
the censorship and by the instrumentality of the two
newly elected Censors, they ejected from the Senate
many of the more contemptible of Sulla’s partisans.
Marcus Aurelius Cotta proposed a reform of the courts
which would have removed the latter almost entirely
from the influence of the dominant party.</p>

<p>Naturally, these discussions, these laws, and these
proposals served only to increase the general excitement;
and of this excitement Verres took advantage
to identify still further his own cause with that of the
party in power. He placed at the disposal of the party
the wealth he had well or badly earned in his province
as well as his influence and his personality. The party
on their side chose as candidates for the consulship
Q. Hortensius, his defending counsel, and Quintus
Metellus, who was a great friend of Verres; for the
prætorship, Marcus Metellus, a brother of Quintus
and no less than Quintus a friend of Verres. They
opposed with all their force the law proposed by Cotta,
which would have transformed the courts in a manner
most unfavourable to Verres’s interests. The Democratic
party in their turn took the Sicilians’ cause
under their protection, to the extent of choosing Cicero,
their illustrious advocate, as candidate for the ædileship.</p>

<p>Thus the elections of the year 70 promised to be
bound up in the trial of Verres. They seemed likely
to be the means by which the two parties would
endeavour to influence public opinion in favour of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
prosecution or of the defence. Unfortunately, when
Cicero, after an absence of about two months returned
to Rome from Sicily, with abundant matter in the
shape of documents and proofs, he found the situation
of the popular party, and consequently his action
against Verres—for its fate was bound up in that of the
party—gravely compromised by a rupture which had
arisen between the two Consuls. There was no love
lost between Pompey and Crassus. Each was jealous
of the other. In putting themselves at the head of the
Democratic party, they had been guided by ambition
and political calculations. But they were both too rich,
and had too many ties with, and friendships among,
the dominant party—from which both of them came—to
be able to infuse much zeal and sincerity into their
services to the opposition. As a result, each had ended
by attacking the other; and these attacks, after some
months of activity, had paralysed the Democratic
party, and restored boldness and confidence to the
Conservative party, which was now resolved to wreck
the law of judicial reform and to obtain Verres’s acquittal,
the two triumphs at which it aimed.</p>

<p>When Cicero returned, the elections were imminent,
and because of their imminence everyone was in a state
of preoccupation and uncertainty. It would not have
been prudent for either party to incur the risk of the
trial before the elections. So the trial was postponed
without any difficulty or opposition. It was the month
of June; and, in the following July, the elections would,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
as usual, take place. Those for the consulship and
prætorship were a great triumph for Verres. Quintus
Hortensius and Quintus Metellus were elected Consuls;
Marcus Metellus was elected Prætor. Verres had
conquered all along the line! The evening of the day
on which the Consuls were elected, Verres was publicly
congratulated on the result near the Arch of Fabius
by several members of the aristocracy; and one of them,
Caius Curion, told him in so many words that “the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">comitia</i> had acquitted him.” Cicero was naturally
much upset; but he did not lose heart. He discontinued
for some time working up his case, and devoted
himself entirely to his election to the ædileship. The
Democratic party had realised that, after their want
of success in the elections to the consulship and the
prætorship, a further failure in the shape of Cicero’s
non-election would seriously compromise their chances
in the prosecution of Verres. In fact, Verres and his
friends were working like demons against Cicero, using
against him all the resources of money, intrigue, and
calumny. Those were days of anxiety and turmoil
for Cicero, the days of the struggle, but, thanks to the
energetic support on this occasion of Pompey, Cicero
was elected.</p>

<p>The elections over, attention was again directed to
the trial, the opening of which was fixed for the 5th of
August; and the two parties began to sharpen their
weapons for the decisive and supreme issue. There
were two phases to a Roman trial; in the initial phase,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
the prosecutor had the first word, opening his case, and
the defendant replied; the witnesses also were heard.
Then followed a suspension of the proceedings, after
which the prosecutor once more spoke and the defendant
once more replied. Then the jury—for the Court
was composed of a jury drawn by lot from the body
of Senators and presided over by the Prætor—gave its
verdict. Those in favour of acquittal wrote an A
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">absolvo</i>) on the waxed tablet, those in favour of conviction
wrote a C (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">condemno</i>). Cicero’s intention was to
abbreviate his opening statement as much as possible;
then to bring forward a large number of witnesses whom
he had brought from Sicily and collected in Rome, so
as to make a complete history of the whole of Verres’s
political life and administration. The charge against
Verres was that he had extorted forty million <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sestertii</i>
from the provincials. But it would not satisfy Cicero
to prove only this point. He wanted to show that
Verres had been guilty of the countless rascalities
which the popular voice attributed to him, beginning
from the time of his first occupation of the office of
quæstor; in short, to reconstruct with the help of witnesses
and documentary evidence the whole of his
public and private life. To strengthen the impression
made by his case, he intended to bring the witnesses
forward in groups corresponding to the different
charges, and to introduce one group after the other,
prefacing the introduction of each group with a short
explanatory speech, in such a way as to focus the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
attention of the public each time on a definite and
precise episode in Verres’s career.</p>

<p>This method of procedure on the part of the prosecution
may seem to us barbarous and inhuman. We
should think it atrocious if, even against the greatest
of scoundrels, the prosecution instituted an inquiry
into the whole of his life in order to punish him for,
and to convict him of, a single offence. Against such
methods, we should not expect anyone, however innocent,
to be able to defend himself. And yet, so greatly
do feelings and ideas change in the world—Verres and
most of his friends had hopes of finding their best line
of defence in this relentless prosecution. An all-embracing
accusation, such as Cicero intended to make,
might, it is true, annihilate a man; but it required much
time, days and days of discussion. Now, time was the
ally on which Verres and his friends counted most
confidently. The trial began on the 5th of August;
the 16th to the 31st of August were the dates fixed
for the celebration of the games which Pompey had
promised for years past in memory of his victories over
Sertorius. During this interval, the trial would have
to be suspended. Further suspensions would be
necessary from the 4th to the 19th of September,
because of the Roman games; from the 26th of October
to the 4th of November because of the games of Victory;
from the 4th to the 17th of November because of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ludi plebei</i>. Thanks to this abundance of games, then,
there was a prospect, especially when Cicero’s wish to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
amplify the indictment was taken into account, that
the discussion would be unduly prolonged. Other
pretexts for postponement would surely not be wanting.
In the meantime public interest would flag;
and, if one could look forward to the new year,
the presidency of the jury would pass to the new
Prætor, Marcus Metellus, who was an intimate friend
of Verres. With his connivance, it would be easy to
find a way of bringing the prosecution to an end with
a convenient acquittal. In fact, Hortensius advised
Verres to let Cicero call as many witnesses as he wished,
and to let them talk freely, without contradicting them
and without being drawn into a discussion with them,
but listening to them in austere and contemptuous
silence.</p>

<p>The doubtful and decisive point, then, of this great
struggle was this: whether greater success would attend
Cicero in his efforts to move the public with his tenacious
and insistent accusations, or Verres and his friends
in their efforts to tire out that public with their passive
resistance. At last, on August 5th, the trial, the
preparations for which had occupied so many months,
began. The public expectations and curiosity were
immense. The struggles and intrigues of the parties
had by now converted the trial into a political event.
The Democratic opposition wanted Verres to be convicted,
so as to inflict a humiliation on the dominant
party and to be able to accuse it of countenancing the
pillage of the provinces. The Conservative party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
wished for Verres’s acquittal so as to be able to assert
that these accusations of misgovernment, like so many
others that had been launched on previous occasions
against other governors, were calumnies concocted by
the Democratic party, and noxious calumnies to boot,
inasmuch as they jeopardised the prestige of the Empire
amongst its subjects. Rome was, during these weeks,
full of Italians from the North and South, who had come
for the elections, the games, and the new census; hence
the trial gained in general interest and importance.
During the days of waiting for the Pompeian games to
begin, this great trial, in which Hortensius and Cicero,
the Conservative aristocracy and the Popular party,
were to be pitted against each other, promised to
be an interesting way of passing the time for all those
strangers who had nothing to do. In ancient Rome,
as in all parts of the world nowadays, trials were a
gratuitous spectacle much to the taste of the public.
Thus, on that morning of the 5th of August, an immense
crowd thronged the Forum, round the benches on which
the judges, the prosecution, the defendant, and his
supporters were to take their seats.</p>

<p>Verres showed a proud and resolute bearing, and
appeared surrounded by a crowd of influential friends.
Cicero had the first word, and made a short speech,
in which he did not refer to any of the facts to which
his witnesses were expected to testify, saying that he
would let them speak for themselves. He preferred
to deal generically with the political and moral importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
of the trial. He said that the provinces, nay,
the whole Empire was anxiously following the proceeding
which would tell whether there were judges
and any hope of justice in Rome. He concluded with
a dexterous reference to the suspicions of corruption
which were flying about, and to the boasts that Verres
was supposed to have made of his ability, with the help
of his money, to flout with impunity every court of
justice. It was for Hortensius to reply to Cicero’s
speech; but he complained that it had been so vague
and generic that it contained no single point which he
could seize and demolish.</p>

<p>Then began a long procession of witnesses, and a
fierce and venomous lot they were, with terrible tales
for the ears of the judges and the public! In order to
secure Verres’s conviction and sentence to a fine of one
hundred million <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sestertii</i>, under the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lex de pecuniis
repetundis</i>, Cicero produced witnesses who accused
him of every sort of crime; of having committed acts
of sacrilege, of having gone shares with the pirates
whom he ought to have harried and destroyed, of
having been guilty of numberless acts of peculation
and malversation, and of having condemned Roman
citizens to death! To prove these charges, Cicero had
unearthed hundreds of witnesses from every class of
society, of both sexes, and of all ages, who, carefully
coached and prepared beforehand, entered the witness-box
to add their quota to the fierce attacks on Verres.
It is difficult to judge how much of these impassioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
and violent stories was true, and how much pure
invention, as we have no documentary evidence relating
to this trial other than the speeches for the prosecution.
Besides, Verres, as we have said, did not avail himself
of the right of cross-examination which the law allowed
him. He allowed the avalanche of charges to slide
unchecked down the slope, and to hurl itself into the
valley, hoping that it would stop of its own accord.
However, it is not improbable that the evidence contained
no small number of exaggerations. A Sicilian
friend of mine, an eminent politician and a man with a
profound knowledge of his native island, is constantly
reminding me that, even at the present day, the Sicilians
throw so much passion into their political struggles
that great circumspection is required in sifting the
accusations hurled by one side against the other, when
rivalry and party animosity come into play. “Only
imagine,” he says, “how it must have been in ancient
times.” Besides, everyone who reads Cicero’s speeches
cannot help feeling, from time to time, that the list of
villainies he enumerates is really too long even for the
greatest villain that ever lived.</p>

<p>Although we to-day can pass a dispassionate judgment
on the events of twenty centuries ago, their
contemporaries, embroiled in the turmoil of unbridled
passions, were not capable of so great detachment.
At this point, a phenomenon occurred which neither
Cicero, Hortensius, nor Verres had foreseen. Public
opinion, which had been grumbling for a long time at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
the excesses of the oligarchical government, and which
was ready to extend blind credence to such charges as
the subtle propaganda of the democratic opposition
devised, gave birth to one of those formidable and
unexpected movements which no human force can
resist. Day by day, as the evidence of the witnesses
spread from the Forum through the city, was digested,
embroidered, exaggerated from mouth to mouth,—in
those days, conversation performed the function of
newspapers, with the same defects, imprecision, and
exaggeration, as the latter,—an ungovernable wave of
indignation against Verres swept over Rome. No one
set himself to sift the evidence dispassionately, or by
subtle analysis to separate the true from the legendary.
The weightier and the more terrible the charges against
Verres, the more readily they found credence. Each
succeeding day saw an increase in the public indignation
and fury, as well as in the crowd that filled the Forum.
On the day on which a witness deposed that Verres had
condemned to death a Roman citizen who had in vain
cried, “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Civis Romanus sum</i>,” such a hubbub and commotion
arose among the public that the Prætor was
obliged to close the sitting in hot haste, for fear of
some great calamity if the case proceeded. For five,
six, seven, even for ten days, Verres and his defenders
faced the storm, hoping that the wind would shift,
that, after the first burst of passion was spent, public
opinion would veer round, regain self-control, and re-enter
a state of calm, conducive to reasoning and discussion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Each morning saw the inexorable figure of
Cicero at the head of a new handful of witnesses, who
came to re-kindle the public indignation by revelations
of new crimes and villainies, real or imaginary.</p>

<p>When, after fourteen days of discussion, the first
phase of the case came to an end and there was a suspension
of proceedings pending the second phase,
Verres, his defenders, and his friends, were obliged to
hold a council of war. The situation was desperate.
The hope of tiring out public opinion with the length of
the proceedings had proved a vain illusion. There was
no longer room for hope that the court might acquit
Verres. Even if every one of the judges had been convinced
of the entire and complete innocence of Verres,
they would not have dared to acquit him in face of
the excited state of public opinion, for fear of being
suspected of corruption. Rome, Italy, the Empire,
would have declared with one voice that the judges
had absolved Verres because they had been bought
with the gold which he had extorted in such quantities
from the Sicilians. The public clamoured for their
victim. Besides, even supposing that the judges
had the inconceivable courage to acquit Verres, his
political career, after such a scandal, was at an end.
What use was it then to persist with the struggle,
when the battle was already irretrievably lost? It was
best to give in. Verres had better not show himself
further at the trial, and had better go into voluntary
exile. In that case, he was sure to be fined much less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
heavily, and to save his patrimony from the wreck
of his political fortunes.</p>

<p>Verres bowed his head to destiny, which had chosen
him to be, in the eyes of Italy and the Empire, the
victim sacrificed to expiate the misdeeds and the outrages
committed by all the Roman governors since the
restoration of Sulla. When the trial began again,
for the second and decisive phase, he did not put in an
appearance. He had already gone into exile. Such
was the delight of the judges that, by declaring himself
guilty, he had spared them the unpleasant and
responsible task of doing so themselves, that they
inflicted upon him the lightest of punishments. They
condemned him to pay, not <em>one hundred</em> millions, as
the Sicilians demanded, but only <em>three</em> millions of
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sestertii</i>. A fine of three million <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sestertii</i> was the judicial
imprimatur on a trial, in the course of which a member
of the Roman aristocracy had been accused by a host
of witnesses of the greatest atrocities and outrages,
some of which, if true, would have sufficed to bring
him to the scaffold.</p>

<p>When we read the violent speeches which Cicero
wrote after the trial, and which he would have pronounced,
if it had continued into its second phase,
in order to sum up and point the moral of the terrible
evidence which had been given against Verres; when we
compare these speeches and the charges which they
formulate, annotate, and tabulate with the lenient and
light penalty inflicted, we can, at first blush, only feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
surprise. The historian asks himself whether the
whole of this trial—which is certainly one of the most
famous in the history of the world—was not a sort of
comedy played by actors of great skill for the benefit
of an ignorant and ingenuous public. Such a judgment
would, however, be too severe. Cicero was an honourable
and upright man, and defended the cause of his
Sicilian clients with sincerity and loyalty. No, this
trial was not simply a judicial episode. It was a
political drama, and, like all political dramas, was overlaid
with phenomena which to a certain extent hide
its real nature and essence from the eyes of posterity
as it hid these from those of its contemporaries. It
must not be forgotten that all the actors in this trial,
the accused, the prosecutor, the defending counsel, and
the judges, belonged to the same aristocracy. At a
certain moment this aristocracy had found itself
compelled, by intestinal quarrels and by a complex
political situation, to sacrifice, in a trial at law, one of
its members in order to satisfy public opinion, Italy,
and the Empire; in order to prove that it was not true,
as a whole party was busy whispering about Rome,
that the Roman governors, provided they belonged to
the Conservative aristocracy, were allowed to do what
they liked in the provinces and that their subjects were
abandoned defenceless to their caprices and their
greed. But the particular member of the aristocracy
whom it was found necessary to sacrifice, whether he
were or were not so great a villain as his enemies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
asserted, had friends, protectors, and supporters who
exerted an influence sufficiently great amongst the
dominant party to admit of too ruthless an attack
being made upon him.</p>

<p>Cicero himself who apparently attacks Verres with
such fury, in reality endeavours to do him as little
harm as possible. At every stage of his comments on
the serious evidence of the witnesses, he says that, if
Verres is not convicted under the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lex de pecuniis
repetundis</i>, he will accuse him of a greater crime, as
though to persuade him that the prosecution has had
the utmost possible regard for him. In short, the
trial and the condemnation of Verres were a twofold
satisfaction which the Roman aristocracy was forced
to offer to the public opinion of Italy and to the
provinces; but, while offering it, she tried, in every
possible way, to temper the blow to the predestined
victim. In fact, Verres, though forced to renounce
every political ambition, was able to live the life of a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grand seigneur</i> quietly in Italy. And that is actually
what he did, devoting himself especially to the collection
of those works of art for which he had such a passion.
After the trial, there is no mention of him in Roman
history. He disappears; and, after the year 70, his
name does not reappear till more than twenty-seven
years later as one of the victims of the famous proscriptions
organised in 43 and 42 by Antonius, Lepidus,
and Octavianus: the same proscriptions in which
Cicero, his accuser, perished. Inasmuch as Verres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
had been for the elapsed twenty-seven years but an
obscure spectator of the political struggles of Rome,
it is clear that he must have been included in the lists
of the proscribed because his riches excited the cupidity
of the Triumvirs.</p>

<p>The famous trial, while it cut short Verres’s political
career, brought Cicero’s to the heights of success. The
trial of Verres made of Cicero, who up to that time
had been a promising young man, one of the foremost
political figures in Rome. The Conservative aristocracy
recognised in him an orator whose eloquence
might be terrible. The Democratic party was grateful
to him for the humiliation which he had inflicted on
the dominant party. Italy and the provinces welcomed
in him the honourable Senator, the disinterested advocate,
the intrepid defender of down-trodden justice,
the man who had publicly affirmed, at no small risk
to himself, that Rome owed it to her own honour to
govern with equity and uprightness the immense
empire of which fortune had made her mistress.
Assuredly, Cicero deserved such admiration, even
though his attack on Verres had not been so bitter
as the public supposed.</p>

<p>The trial of Verres is the first great page in Cicero’s
history. Who could, however, have prophesied to
him, in 70, that history would write the name of Verres
beside his own yet once again, but on the last page,
that of a tragic and glorious death? How life teems
with strange coincidences! These two men who confronted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
each other in one of the most famous legal
duels in history, who separated with faces turned
towards such diverse destinies—the conqueror to find
glory and power, the conquered to find obscurity and
seclusion—were fated to meet once more in life, at the
last hour, on the brink of the same abyss.</p>

This goddess was one of Rome’s strangest deities. She
represented fertility; and the object of the December
ceremonies was to move the goddess to grant that all
the fountains of fertility which nourish the life and
prosperity of a nation might flow copiously throughout
the year. Women only were admitted to the festivities,
which were due to take place at night in the house
of the Consul or of the Prætor. The wife of the Prætor
or of the Consul presided; the lady members of the
aristocracy took part; but the master of the house, with
all the male slaves, was required to absent himself.
It was popularly believed that the man who dared to
take part in the mysteries of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bona Dea</i> would be
immediately struck blind.</p>

<p>In that particular year, the ceremonies took place in
the house of Julius Cæsar, who was Prætor at the time,
under the presidency of his wife, Pompeia, and his
mother, Aurelia. Cæsar had left the house, which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
been decorated as the rites required. All the ladies
of the aristocracy had assembled there, and the mysterious
ceremonies were being carried on through the
night, as usual, when in one of the rooms a slave
belonging to Cæsar’s mother encountered a musician
who seemed to have lost her way in the huge house, and
not to know what she ought to do or where to go. The
slave asked the stranger whom or what she was looking
for. The musician did not answer. The slave, her
suspicions aroused by the other’s silence, persisted
with her questions. The musician was driven at last
to say that she was looking for one of Pompeia’s slaves,
by name Abra. But Aurelia’s slave was horror-struck
when she heard the musician’s voice. It was the voice
of a man! At once, with loud screams, she gave the
alarm. A man, a man disguised as a woman, was
present at the sacred rites of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bona Dea</i>! The
musician bolted. Cæsar’s mother, a dignified and
energetic woman, suspended the ceremonies, immediately
ordered all the doors to be shut, and, followed by
all the matrons, searched the house thoroughly from
top to bottom. At last the musician was found hidden
in Abra’s room; and several of the ladies present
believed they recognised in her a young Roman patrician,
famous in Rome for the blueness of his blood,
and for his extravagance: Publius Clodius. He was
expelled from the house, and the meeting broke up.</p>

<p>Next day, all Rome knew that Publius Clodius had
dared to try to profane the mysteries of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bona Dea</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
and the news created an immense sensation. Publius
Clodius was the youthful descendant of one of Rome’s
most ancient, illustrious, and famous patrician houses.
His father, his grandfather, his great-grandfather, and
his great-great-grandfather had all been Consuls.
Thus he belonged to one of those families which impersonated
in the eyes of Italy the glory, the power, and the
virtue of Rome. That the youthful scion of one of
these venerated families should have dared to commit
such a sacrilege was a thing which would have made
a painful impression in Rome at any time. But the
moment was a critical and uncertain one. The impression
made by the conspiracy of Catiline was still lively
and fresh. Everywhere, especially in the more respectable
section of society, a feeling of disgust mingled
with fear prevailed. The public was in favour of
severe measures. All seriously minded people gave it
as their opinion that the prevailing licence of manners,
and especially the effrontery of the young men, must
be curbed, if the Empire was not to crumble into decay.
If matters had come to such a pass that a Claudius, a
man whose name had for so many centuries spelt to the
Romans all the austere and traditional virtues of the
Roman citizenship of old, dared profane the most
sacred rites of religion, what might not be feared at
the hands of a creedless, dissolute, corrupt youth,
which was preparing to invade, with the new generation,
the official posts of the Republic?</p>

<p>Great, therefore, was the public indignation; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
strict party, captained by Cato, a small party but
active and powerful in the Senate, perceived that now
was the moment to make an example. That Clodius
had, up to that time, served the Conservative party,
the aristocratic community which Sulla had restored
to power; that in the conspiracy of Catiline he had
zealously helped Cicero and defended the cause of
the order, counted for little, nay, rather was it all to the
good. It was necessary to show the people that the
aristocracy could still, as in the good old times, bring
themselves to strike at their own members, when they
failed in their most sacred duties.</p>

<p>The tales which soon spread among the public as to
the reasons for the sacrilege only served to fan the
flame of indignation. It was whispered that Clodius
was the paramour of Pompeia, Cæsar’s wife; and that
he had endeavoured, with the connivance of Abra,
Pompeia’s slave, to gain an entrance into the festivities,
for the purpose of an assignation with her! The sacrilege,
therefore, was twofold. The rites of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bona
Dea</i> were intended to assure the prosperity of the
people. It was infamous that a young aristocrat should
have dared to take advantage of them to further an
intrigue of gallantry. An example must be made;
this was for several days the general chorus throughout
Rome. The most sacred things of the Republic could
not be left a prey to this corrupt and depraved youth.
The cynicism of a few dissolutes must not be allowed to
expose the Republic to the wrath of the gods!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span></p>

<p>An example must be made—certainly! But how?
The law contained no provision applying to such an act
as Clodius had committed. Anyone desirous of prosecuting
him would not have known what law to invoke
in order to hale him before the judges. The case was
unprecedented; and it had never occurred to anyone to
write it down a crime, with a definite legal imprimatur
attached. The ancient code was extremely formal, especially
in questions of rites and religion, and so Clodius’s
deed remained a wicked, impious, and shameful one,
which was calculated to cover him with infamy, but
which could not be punished by the law. Sensible,
cautious, and prudent people, in the Senate, and out of
it, lost no time in convincing themselves on this point;
while Clodius, his friends, and his family, which was a
most influential one, began to intercede, to pray, and to
intrigue. It was true that Clodius had committed an
act of unpardonable levity, which would ruin his political
career for all time. But it was an act for which
there was no punishment, save the reprobation of all
good citizens.</p>

<p>So colourless a solution was, however, not at all to
the taste of the public, which was deeply moved by the
sacrilege, and roused to fury against these great families
who abused their power in so scandalous a way. The
public demanded a severer punishment. The small
Pietist party, feeling itself backed by public opinion,
brought the matter before the Senate, by the mouth
of an obscure Senator named Quintus Cornificius.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
Cornificius proposed that the College of Pontiffs be
consulted, and their opinion asked as to the gravity and
character of the crime committed by Clodius. The
proposal was an ingenious one. According to ancient
ideas, it was incumbent on the State itself to take
precautions that the gods should have no motive for
losing their tempers with the people and the city,
and thereupon wreaking vengeance upon Rome. With
the public thrown into such a state of fear and commotion
by Clodius’s sacrilege, the Senate could not
refuse to consult the Pontiffs, to learn from them
whether this act constituted an outrage against the
gods, and, if so, an outrage of what gravity. The
College of Pontiffs answered that the act was <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nefas</i>—the
technical expression which indicated the gravest of
delinquencies towards the divinity. Their answer
could not have been otherwise. Nevertheless, however
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nefas</i> the act might be, there was no law which
punished it.</p>

<p>So when the answer of the College of Pontiffs reached
the Senators, the latter found themselves confronted
with the following situation. A very grave and
scandalous crime had been committed by one of the
best-known members of the aristocracy. This crime
had stirred the public indignation to its depths, and had
been declared <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nefas</i> by the College of Pontiffs. Yet
there was no way of punishing it, because the arsenal
of the law did not provide the weapons necessary for
its punishment. The danger inherent in this state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
affairs was obvious. The public, infuriated and dismayed,
would never believe that Clodius could not be
punished—because the laws had never even imagined
that such an abomination could ever be committed by a
Roman. The public would declare that Clodius had
escaped his richly-deserved punishment because he
belonged to one of the most conspicuous and influential
families in Rome. The aristocracy was superior to the
law; it could even provoke with impunity the wrath of
the gods against the city! What was to be done?
Public opinion, in its agitated state, kept egging on the
Senate; and the Pietist and ruthless party, profiting by
the popular agitation, attempted a daring move, proposing
to the Senate that it should invite the Consuls to
make a special law, which should have retrospective
force, and should declare Clodius’s act on a plane with
the crime of incest,—make it equivalent, that is, to the
seduction of a vestal virgin, a crime which, according
to ancient law, was punishable with death, and which
fell to be judged by the College of Pontiffs. Nevertheless,
no one, not even Cato, could delude himself
into thinking that the College of Pontiffs would condemn
Clodius to death. Consequently, the law proposed
to constitute a special tribunal,—which would
not be that of the Pontiffs, nor the usual jury, chosen by
lot. The Prætor would himself constitute it, choosing
it from the panel of judges. It was hoped in this way to
contrive a Court which would condemn Clodius at
least to exile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<p>It is not difficult to realise how daring and dangerous
it was to propose such a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">privilegium</i>, as the Romans
used to call exceptional laws, in times of uproar like
those, and in the midst of the fierce discords which already
for so many reasons were splitting up the Roman
aristocracy. But the indignation and commotion of
the public, superstitious and fearful as it was, were too
lively. Cæsar himself had felt the necessity of throwing
a sop to the public by divorcing Pompeia; and the Senate
dared not reject the rash proposal, even though
many wise men, like Cicero, thought that it would be
more prudent to let Clodius fry in his own grease.
The two Consuls were invited to draft the law and to
get it approved by the people.</p>

<p>From this moment, however, difficulties began; and,
in a few weeks, the prosecution of Clodius assumed a
new aspect. It became a political matter. That the
act he had committed was an abominable one, no one in
Rome denied; but that in order to secure his punishment
a law should be passed which would not only be a
special one, but—most important point of all—would
introduce the principle of the selection of judges by the
Prætor,—no, to this the Popular, Democratic party
could not consent. Always concerned not to leave in
the hands of Sulla’s party, which was still so powerful in
the Senate and throughout the Republic, too many
weapons to employ against their enemies, the Popular
party had recently taken to demanding with the utmost
emphasis the most rigorous observance of legal forms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
especially in proceedings in the law-courts, which were
such a convenient means, in the hands of the preponderant
party, of getting rid of the latter’s adversaries. In
fact, at that moment the Popular party had begun an
agitation against the illegalities committed in the
course of the repression of Catiline’s conspiracy.
This law, therefore, sounded like a challenge. As a
matter of fact, of the two Consuls whose duty it was to
bring it forward, one, Marcus Pupius Piso, though he
had not dared resist the proposal openly in the Senate,
was opposed to it; and, while he made a show of obeying
the orders of the Senate and actually did, with his
colleague, propose the law, he busied himself behind
the scenes to secure its rejection. The other Consul,
Marcus Valerius Messala, on the other hand, was an
enthusiastic supporter of the law; but it was whispered
about that a tribune of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">plebs</i>, if the law was brought
forward, would veto it. Clodius and his relations
worked away vigorously. All the wise and prudent
men, even Cicero, held themselves in reserve, keeping
an eye on the progress of events without compromising
themselves too far; so that Cicero, writing at the end of
January, 61, to Atticus, could give him to understand between
the lines that the law would never be passed, and
that the whole business would be brought to a stand-still
by the fizzing away of the public anger. For the
rest, this was the secret wish of all level-headed citizens,
who, like Cicero, feared dreadful calamities, if the business
were allowed to assume more serious proportions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

<p>But all the wiseacres reckoned without Cato and the
Pietist party, and without the obstinacy of Messala,
who, irritated by the stolid opposition of his colleague,
countered it with a determined effort to get the law
passed. Between them all, they worked and spoke
with such effect that they succeeded in obtaining the
support of Pompey, and in bringing the law before the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">comitia</i> in the first fortnight of February. Piso, however,
was no less resolutely determined than Messala
that the law he had proposed should not be passed, and,
as it was his turn to preside over the meeting, he had
recourse that day to every sort of subtle device to
prevent the law being passed. He even went so far as
to distribute to the voters only that tablet which they
would use in rejecting the law. When the heads of the
Conservative party, Cato, Hortensius, and Favonius,
heard of this extraordinary intrigue, they hurried to the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">comitia</i> and began to address the people. Cato distinguished
himself by a virulent attack on Piso. The
speeches were effectual in preventing the law from being
put to the vote, and therefore from being, as it assuredly
would have been, rejected. They could not, however,
procure its approval, which, from Clodius’s point of
view, and for the moment at any rate, came to much the
same thing.</p>

<p>Men’s passions began to get the better of them. The
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i> of the two small factions came more
prominently into play the more the case assumed a
political aspect. Inasmuch as the opposition of one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
of the two Consuls who had proposed the law was the
greatest impediment to the approval of the law, means
must be found for getting rid of Piso. The Pietists
thought of exerting pressure upon him by means of the
Senate. They summoned a meeting of the Senate on
urgent business, and proposed a motion inviting the
Consuls once more to join in recommending the law to
the popular vote; in other words, intimating to Piso
that he had better abandon his attitude of obstruction.
A lively discussion ensued. The friends of Clodius
opposed the motion with great energy; but it was
carried by four hundred votes to fifteen. A truly
crushing majority! Clodius’s act was so offensive to the
public that few Senators dared openly to side with
him, even though they were conscious that the law
which was meant to bring him to book was fraught
with danger.</p>

<p>Piso, however, did not allow this vote of the Senate
to influence him. The discontent of the Popular party
was increasing, and the public agitation, not in favour
of Clodius, but against the law, was gathering force,
being focussed on that particular provision which
undoubtedly was the most dangerous, namely, the
authority given to the Prætor to choose the judges
from the panel of jurors instead of entrusting the choice
to the fortune of the lot. The law, it is true, established
this procedure only for the purposes of the action
against Clodius. But was not the precedent a dangerous
one? Would it not be possible, after this first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
experiment, to try to apply the same method to other
cases? That would result in putting into the hands of
the preponderant party a formidable weapon for the
destruction of its adversaries: the giving to the Prætor
in office the power to choose the judges who should be
summoned to decide the numberless cases by means of
which that party sought to deprive their rivals of their
most influential leaders.</p>

<p>So the struggle waxed fiercer and fiercer. Piso
would not give way, and the Popular party supported
him, never mentioning Clodius, but asserting that the
law was unjust, dangerous, and deadly—that the
death-blow would be given to the Republic on the day
on which a magistrate, elected by, and bound by ties to,
one party, was invested with the power to choose the
judges for every law-suit. The Pietist party, supported
by the majority of the Senate, and by the Sullan
association, adopted the opposite tactics. It made
light of the provisions of the law and the dangers
anticipated and denounced by the Popular party. It
protested that Clodius had committed a horrible
sacrilege, and could not be allowed to go unpunished
without compromising still further in the eyes of the
disgusted and affrighted masses the waning authority
of the State. Intrigues and plots thickened on this side
and on that. Both sides endeavoured to influence public
opinion, but in this attempt the Popular party was
the more successful. For that party, by dint of dogged
and dexterous efforts, and without paying any regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
to the votes of the Senate, which was almost unanimously
favourable to the opposite party, succeeded in
persuading the public that the law was immoderate,
tyrannical, and dangerous, especially in the matter of
the powers entrusted to the Prætor.</p>

<p>The day arrived when the more enlightened men of
the Conservative party realised that the law, in the form
in which it had been drafted, would never be approved.
Piso by himself, helped by the Popular party and by the
growing mistrust of public opinion, sufficed to checkmate
the majority of the Senate and the party in power.
It was necessary, therefore, to devise a compromise.
And the man who devised it was Hortensius, the great
orator who ten years before had been Verres’s defending
counsel. He proposed that the two Consuls should
abandon their law; and that Fusius Calenus, who was
tribune of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">plebs</i>, should bring forward another, in
which the first part of the preceding law, that which
made of Clodius’s act an incest, should be retained,
but the second part should be modified in such a way
that the judges summoned to administer it should not
be the College of Pontiffs but the ordinary jury, chosen
in the ordinary way, that is to say, by lot, and not, as
the law of the two Consuls proposed, by the Prætors.
By this equable compromise Hortensius hoped to
satisfy all parties—he disarmed the opposition of the
Popular party, which would not dare, now that the
law had been purged of the provision which aroused
the greatest mistrust in the public, to persist in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
opposition, and to risk appearing too openly to desire
the protection of Clodius. He gave a sop to public
opinion, which was deeply stirred and offended by the
scandal. He gave satisfaction to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i>
of the Conservative party, by presenting them with the
head of Clodius. As a matter of fact, he thought—and
this was the argument he used to persuade the most
recalcitrant of the Pietist party—that it was not
necessary to alter the mode of choosing the judges.
Clodius’s guilt was so evident that it was quite impossible
to imagine that a court of law, however corrupt,
could acquit him.</p>

<p>The first of Hortensius’s anticipations quickly came
true. The law, thus modified, passed without difficulty.
At once, several citizens hastened to indict Clodius
of incest. Matters had not gone far, however, before
everyone perceived that Hortensius’s second anticipation,
that the conviction of Clodius was inevitable,
would not be realised so easily. Months had passed;
the first impression of horror made on the public had
faded. The Conservative party—the same that had
made such efforts to save Verres—was too deeply
committed to obtaining the conviction of Clodius at
whatever cost, for the Popular party not to take Clodius
under its protection, though it did so covertly and
without compromising itself too far. Crassus and
Cæsar in particular, without appearing on the scene,
were disposed to do whatever they could, to help
Clodius, and to procure him, if it were possible, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
acquittal, an outcome which in no less a degree than
the conviction of Verres, would have been a rebuff for
the party which Sulla had installed in the government,
and which, notwithstanding all the reverses which it
had undergone in recent years, was still so powerful.
Clodius on his side worked with the energy of despair
to escape conviction, which would have shattered his
political career irreparably and forever.</p>

<p>The trial took place at the beginning of May, in the
midst of a curiosity and excitement which may be easily
imagined. The two parties had by now decided to face
each other once again, as in Verres’s time, in the confined
arena of a law-court. The judges were chosen by
lot, and the defendant especially availed himself of the
right which the law conceded to both sides, of challenging
a certain number of them. Nobody was surprised
at this, as everyone knew that the struggle would be a
fierce one, or rather a hopeless one, for the accused.
Indeed, how could Clodius escape conviction, when his
guilt was so manifest? In declaring his act to be
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incestum</i>, the law had already condemned him in
anticipation. When, however, the jury had been
impannelled, and the trial opened, an unexpected and
dramatic incident occurred. Clodius defended himself
by saying that the matrons present at the feast
in honour of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bona Dea</i> had been deceived. They
had mistaken somebody else for him. On that day he
was actually not in Rome, but at Iteramna (Terni)!</p>

<p>Just at first, this alibi made the public laugh. Nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
took it seriously. It seemed to everyone that
Clodius was joking and wished to make fun of the Court,
or that he was trying a desperate coup. But here, too,
they were wrong. Clodius intended that his point be
taken quite seriously, and had prepared his defence
much more cleverly than his adversaries, emboldened
by the certainty of victory, supposed. People were
not slow to realise this, as the trial went on and on,
without producing that proof of Clodius’s guilt which
everybody thought so easy and certain, and without
destroying his daring alibi. The first step was to put
Clodius’s slaves to the torture,—a step which was
allowed in a case in which “incest” was imputed. This
procedure was, however, barren of results. Clodius
had sent the five slaves of whose evidence he was
particularly afraid, partly to his brother in Greece, and
partly to a distant property of his in the Alps. Then
came Cæsar, who had been cited as a witness, and by
whose evidence also the enemies of Clodius set great
store. Had he not divorced his wife immediately after
the scandal? This divorce clearly indicated that
Cæsar considered his wife guilty; a state of mind which
gave ground for hope that he would revenge himself
by charging Clodius. Cæsar, however, had too great an
interest in pleasing Crassus, whose desire to give the
Democratic party the satisfaction of procuring the
acquittal of Clodius was growing keener and keener.
So Cæsar deposed under examination that he knew
nothing and could say nothing, as, in conformity with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
religious precepts, he was out of the house that evening.
Great was the irritation and disappointment of the
prosecutors, one of whom thereupon, in order to put
Cæsar in a difficulty, asked Cæsar for what reason, if he
knew nothing and could say nothing, he had divorced
his wife immediately after the scandal had broken out.
Cæsar then, assuming a solemn air, pronounced the
famous phrase: “Because Cæsar’s wife must be above
suspicion,” a phrase which historians have proceeded to
quote as a proof of his precocious monarchical ambitions
and of his masterful temperament. On the
contrary, the phrase was merely a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">boutade</i>, devised to
elude an embarrassing question in a political trial,
which none of those who heard it took too seriously, and
in saying which Cæsar himself knew quite well that
nobody would take him at his word. In fact, the public
smiled at the idea of the elegant and debt-laden demagogue,
who was known to all for his somewhat free
opinions and customs, having become all at once so
jealous of the spotless reputation of his house.</p>

<p>At any rate, as a loophole the answer was a clever one;
and the prosecutors could not press the question. So
Julia, Cæsar’s sister, and Aurelia, his mother, came
forward. Both deposed that, on the night on which
the mysteries of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bona Dea</i> were celebrated, a man
had been surprised in Cæsar’s house; but that they
could not say with certainty that the defendant was the
man. We should be doing an injustice to the memory
of the two noble dames if we suspected that this evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
was not candid, but prompted by concern for the political
interests and friendships of their brother and son.
Is it not probable that, in the confusion and disorder of
the just-discovered scandal, neither may have scrutinised
the man in female disguise with so much attention
and particularity as to be able to recognise him subsequently
in court, where Clodius denied the identity
with so much assurance? Therefore this evidence
also was in Clodius’s favour; for there was nobody who
could affirm positively that the man surprised in the
middle of the rites of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bona Dea</i> was the accused.</p>

<p>Next came the evidence adduced by Clodius, to
prove his alibi. It took the form of a certain C.
Causinius Schola, who deposed frankly and resolutely
that the gentlemen of the jury might take it from him
that at a certain hour on the day of the mysteries of
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bona Dea</i>, he had conversed with Clodius at Iteramna,
which was ninety thousand <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">passi</i> distant from
Rome. This evidence, after that of Cæsar, Julia, and
Aurelia, made the acquittal of Clodius inevitable.
Certain proofs of his guilt there were none. The
improbable alibi, which at the beginning nobody had
taken seriously, threatened to triumph owing to the
doubts and scruples of a few witnesses, the adroit
reticence of others, and thanks to the subterranean
workings of Clodius’s friends, backed by Crassus’s gold.</p>

<p>Then came a second and even more unexpected surprise.
At the very moment when Clodius seemed to
have emerged victorious, there appeared to destroy his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
alibi.... Who? Cicero himself. Cited as witness,
Cicero deposed that on the day of the mysteries, three
hours before the hour at which Causinius declared that
he had spoken to Clodius at Terni, Clodius had come
to call on him at his house in Rome! What had happened?
Cicero had up to that time adopted a distinctly
reserved attitude, making it clear that he, who since
the suppression of Catiline’s conspiracy had become
one of the leading figures in the State, had no wish to be
mixed up in so trivial and stupid an affair. For what
reason did he thus hurl himself all at once, at the close
of the trial, into the thick of the fight, and opposing his
evidence to that of Causinius, seem to challenge the
jury to choose between his word—the word of a man of
consular rank, the word of one of the three or four most
famous men in the Empire—and that of this obscure
and probably corrupt witness? Had he yielded to the
pressure of the Conservative party, which, realising that
the prey was slipping from their grasp, had wished to
make a supreme attempt to destroy the alibi which
had been so adroitly prepared by Clodius? Had he,
upright and honourable man as he was, yielded to his
disgust at seeing a comedy, which had been staged with
such ability, completely successful? Or had he yielded
to pressure and to considerations of the sort of which
Plutarch speaks? Plutarch says that Cicero’s wife,
Terentia, was jealous of Clodia, Clodius’s sister, whom
she suspected of having cast eyes upon Cicero; and had
so much worried Cicero, by harping upon the subject,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
and accusing him of sparing Clodius out of regard for
the sister, that Cicero, in order to convince her that her
jealousy was groundless, gave the evidence he did.</p>

<p>Which of these suppositions is the true one we do not
know, and we never shall know. What, however, is
certain is that Cicero’s evidence appeared at once to be
the death-blow to Clodius. Clodius’s defenders perceived
this so clearly that they all rose in their seats,
hurling threats and insults at Cicero, hoping to intimidate
him and to obliterate the impression made by his
evidence. Cicero retorted in the same key. One
section of the public, that favourable to Clodius,
supported the advocates. An uproar ensued. The
judges rose from their seats, and formed a circle round
Cicero, as if to defend him. It seemed for one moment
that the partisans were coming to blows. In short,
the whole affair was a scandal, but one which made
Clodius’s position even more grave. Everyone realised
that he considered himself lost. Was it, in truth,
possible that the jury should hesitate between Cicero’s
asseveration and that of Causinius? Clodius himself,
as soon as the uproar had quieted down, realised that
he could not accuse Cicero, a man of such authority, of
lying. Indeed, he did not deny that the fact was as
stated; but he said that after having spoken with
Cicero he had immediately left Rome for Terni. To
which it was easy to reply that in three hours one cannot
cover a distance of ninety thousand <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">passi</i>; and this
reply did not admit of answer, confutation, or sophistication.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
The falseness of the alibi was the gravest of
proofs against Clodius, and that which was bound to
compromise his cause most gravely in the opinion of the
public and of the judges.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day on which Cicero gave his
evidence, there was not a soul in Rome who did not
think that the great orator had dealt the youthful and
turbulent patrician his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de grâce</i>. But Cicero’s
evidence, the tumult and threats which had succeeded,
the self-assurance of the Conservatives, who were now
confident of securing a conviction, only intensified the
bitterness of public feeling. Strange rumours and
whispers began to circulate through Rome, originating
no one knew where. It was said that, on the day the
verdict was given, blood would flow amid scenes of
terrible violence. Some of the judges took fright and
asked the Senate for the protection of an armed bodyguard,
which the Senate gave them. Round Cicero the
Conservative party organised a kind of permanent
demonstration, arranging that he should be accompanied
everywhere by a number of friends ready to defend
him. The idea was to persuade the public in
every possible way that Clodius intended to sneak away,
or even to use violence, so sure was he of conviction,
to shackle the free judgment of the Court. That
conviction was a certainty was the general opinion. In
the midst of these rumours, fears, and suspicions the
case drew rapidly to a close. In the crowded Forum,
surrounded by the swords of the bodyguard supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
by the Senate for the protection of the judges, the
Court finally pronounced its verdict—but how
different it was from that which was universally
expected. By thirty-one votes to twenty-five Clodius
was acquitted!</p>

<p>The surprise, the scandal, the jubilation, the amusement,
according to each man’s disposition and party,
were great in Rome when this result was announced.
In truth, whoever, after the lapse of so many centuries,
reads the history of the trial will find no difficulty in
believing Cicero when he accuses Crassus of having
secured Clodius’s acquittal by the exercise of pressure
and corruption. In no other way can be explained
the fact that a Roman Court of law, forced to choose
between Cicero and Causinius, believed Causinius.
Nevertheless, it is certain that Clodius was much helped
in this struggle by the political mistakes of the Conservative
party, by their blind relentlessness, and
by the obstinacy with which they had endeavoured
for so long to bring about, to the detriment of Clodius,
a change in the method of choosing the judges. At this
epoch, justice in Rome was much too much exposed to
the influence of politics. If, however, the times were
disturbed, if the parties were divided by acute discord
and men’s minds inflamed by the memories of a terrible
civil war, the sense of justice was, nevertheless, not yet
so much blunted by party passions as to allow the
dominant party to abuse their own power beyond a
certain point. Clodius might be a man little deserving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
of public interest; but there were many persons in
Rome to whom it was repugnant that, even for the
purpose of punishing a sacrilege, recourse should be
had to means so unusual, revolutionary, and extreme.</p>

<p>So the Popular party, with the support of the
general sentiment of legality, had succeeded in checkmating
the Conservative party, the Sullan association.
The checkmate in itself was, however, not a serious
one, because the trial of Clodius had not been so
important and complex that his acquittal could seriously
weaken the strength of the Conservative party.
The indirect consequences, on the other hand, were
most serious. The first was that Clodius went over
body and soul to the Popular party, and became the
boldest and most violent of its leaders. If the Conservative
party had followed Cicero’s advice and
abandoned Clodius to the infamy which his act must
have brought upon him, there would have been an end
of Clodius. The man who had profaned the mysteries
of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bona Dea</i> would not have dared to show himself
any more in public. By persecuting him as it did,
and by giving him the chance of posing before the
public as the victim of its persecutions, this unpopular
party saved his career, or at least helped to enable him
to continue to play a part in the political world of Rome,
and a part fraught with danger to the State. Clodius,
realising that, after the trial, he could no longer hope
for anything from the Conservative party in which he
had grown up and in whose ranks he had fought, turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
to the Popular party; and, in order to make that party
forget his origin, his relations, and the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bona Dea</i>
scandal, became the most violent and turbulent of its
chiefs. It is this trial which has made of Clodius the
famous demagogue of whom history tells, who in a few
years contributed so much, with his agitations, his
laws, his violent acts, and his enmities, to the destruction
of the little order and concord that were left in
the Republic. The most violent of his enmities was
that which he entertained for Cicero. From this trial
dates the deadly enmity between the two, which was
not the least of the causes of the great disorder into
which the Republic fell, which gave birth to the civil war.</p>

<p>The trial of Clodius is, then, one of the events which
paved the way for the catastrophe of the Republic.
What an object lesson it is for political parties! In the
excitement of the struggle, such parties reck nothing,
while they deal each other slashing blows, of the hatred
and rancour which they sow broadcast. But this
hatred and rancour undermine in men’s minds the sentiments
of concord, loyalty, moderation, tolerance, and
equity, without which the social order cannot in the
long run subsist; it is one of the most potent causes of
the great catastrophes of history. A revolution is
usually only the ultimate effect of a long succession
of violent acts, affronts, and injustices which have
exasperated the public mind, in which feelings of
rancour accumulate and ferment until one day they
explode.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRIAL OF PISO</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Nearly</span> a century had passed since the trial of
Verres, and more than eighty years since the
trial of Clodius. The quarrels of the Roman aristocracy,
which had given birth to those two extraordinary
and sensational trials, had kindled the spark of two
dreadful civil wars, in the course of which the Empire
had narrowly escaped complete dissolution. Gradually,
however, order had been re-established. From
the midst of the discords of the aristocracy, one family
had emerged and succeeded in acquiring preponderating
influence: the family of the Cæsars. First, Augustus
for forty-two years, and, for the three years succeeding
his death, his stepson and adopted son Tiberius, had
governed the State as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">principes</i>, or life-presidents,
accumulating in their own hands powers of the most
diverse kinds—the supreme command of the legions,
the presidency of the Senate, the high-priesthood, the
surveillance of the most important provinces—and at
the same time making every effort to keep the ancient
machinery of republican government working with as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
little friction as possible under such widely different
conditions and in control of an empire of so much
vaster extent. No law had laid it down that this power
should be hereditary; but the force of circumstances—the
exhaustion of the ancient nobility, the weakness
of the Senate, the dying out of all the parties and
all the powerful cabals which for centuries had bulked
so large in the Republic—made of this family, little
by little, the mistress of the Empire’s destinies.</p>

<p>If, however, the violent disputes of parties no longer
raged in the Senate; if blows were no longer exchanged
in the Forum when the election of the magistrates or
the discussion of the laws was toward; if the threat of
civil war no longer hovered continually over the heads
of all, concord was not, for all that, re-established in
the ranks of the aristocracy which surrounded Cæsar’s
family and which ought to have helped that family to
govern the immense Empire. Men’s feelings were as
much divided as ever, though for different motives.
Tiberius, the second <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">princeps</i> in three years chosen by
the Senate as successor of Augustus, was hated by one
section of the Roman aristocracy, which judged him too
old-fashioned—too closely bound to the traditions of
the old nobility and of his family, the Claudii; too stern,
hard, and rigid; too much out of sympathy with the new
customs and new refinements that were beginning to
flow from Egypt into Italy; too close-fisted and too keen
a professor of a scrupulous and strict financial policy;
worst of all, too cautious in his foreign policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p>An old warrior, who had passed the best years of
his life fighting on the Rhine and the Danube against
the barbarians, a consummate diplomat, head and
shoulders above all his contemporaries in matters
of war and diplomacy, Tiberius had convinced himself
that Rome had not strength enough to extend her
empire beyond the Rhine and the Danube, and that,
therefore, she ought to rest content with the empire
which she had already won, which was, after all, vast
enough for a tiny aristocracy like that which was
seated at Rome. The malcontents, however,—and
there were many of these, especially among the younger
generation,—not only did not recognise Tiberius’s
wisdom, but imputed this sagacious prudence of his
to inexperience, to fear, or to envy of the young and
brilliant Germanicus.</p>

<p>The son of Drusus, the brother whom Tiberius had
so much loved, the adopted son of Tiberius, who had
been enjoined by Augustus to adopt him, intelligent,
brilliant, generous, well-educated, handsome, affable,
inclined to be light-headed and casual like most youths
who are fortune’s favourites, Germanicus was the idol
of all the enemies of Tiberius. He was, and he was
conscious of being, their idol, and, without assuming too
openly an attitude of opposition, he willingly let himself
be worshipped and extolled by the faction opposed to
his adoptive father, which faction was strong enough to
exercise an effective pressure on the Senate and throughout
the State. In fact, Germanicus, who after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
death of Augustus had been sent by Tiberius to take
command of the legions of the Rhine, had dared to
follow a policy of his own, differing from that of Tiberius,
on the Rhine, crossing the great river on his
own initiative, and making a long and hazardous incursion
into the territories abandoned by Rome after
the defeat of Varus.</p>

<p>This incursion—the first step taken by Rome to
avenge Varus and his legions, which had been betrayed
and butchered in the great forest—had evoked such
enthusiasm in Rome and in Italy; Germanicus was so
popular; the expansionist party, always strong and
now reinforced by all the enemies of Tiberius, had made
so much of the daring act of the young general,
that Tiberius had not dared to intervene, to repress,
or to moderate the dashing initiative of his young
nephew and adopted son. So he let Germanicus go
on. On no account and at no cost would Tiberius,
however, again begin beyond the Rhine a dangerous
and expensive policy of provocation and expansion.
Therefore, after having allowed Germanicus to cover
himself with glory through his expedition, to collect and
to bury in the great forests the bones of the butchered
legions, and to lay waste the territories of the tribes
which had taken part in the war against Rome, he
called him back, in order to send him—in the year 17
of the Christian era—to the East, complications and
difficulties having arisen in Cappadocia and Armenia.
He was not prepared to leave this ambitious, active,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
bold youth, the tool of his own enemies, too long at
grips with the warlike German tribes. He was afraid
that the all-powerful craving for glory might lead
Germanicus to provoke in the end some great and
dangerous war. In Rome, the party which favoured
the reconquest of Germany was still powerful. Tiberius
did not want to reconquer that region. In the
East, amongst unwarlike nations, the danger was less
urgent.</p>

<p>So Germanicus was sent to the East—but, by way of
compensation for his recall, he was given unusually large
powers. When the time came to approve the decree
which conferred these powers upon him, the party of
his friends in the Senate proposed and carried a motion
giving him power overriding that of all the governors of
the separate provinces of the whole East; the result
being that he was constituted a sort of governor-general
or even viceroy. Whether Tiberius was personally in
favour of this decree, which placed half the Empire
in the absolute power of a young man of little more than
thirty years of age, or not, we do not know. The
probability is that he was not, and that on this occasion
also Tiberius was the victim of the intrigues and cabals
of the party which favoured his nephew and adopted
son. It was very difficult for him to oppose laws which
heaped honours on the public darling, Germanicus,
because the public imputed his opposition to base
motives, such as jealousy, envy, or the fear of opposition.
What is certain, at any rate, is that, after this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
decree, Tiberius suddenly changed the governor in
Syria, the most important province in the East, the
choice of whose governors rested with him. He replaced
the mediocre person who then occupied the post
by a first-rate man, Cneius Piso, a descendant of one of
the most noble Roman families, of a family which had
distinguished itself in the civil wars by its aversion to
the Cæsarian party; of a family, in short, which was
aristocratic, traditionalist, and conservative to the
core. Cneius Piso himself was a determined, conservative,
and energetic man, a firm partisan of the old
policy with which Rome had kept in subjection and
governed so many nations for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Tiberius’s idea is quite clear to anyone who examines
it impartially. He did not wish to leave the East at the
mercy of Germanicus, who was intelligent and good, but
still young, inexperienced, and not always deliberate,
and who was easily influenced by light-headed, irresponsible,
and often vicious and corrupt flatterers.
He wished to place, at Germanicus’s elbow in the
East, a serious, mature, energetic, and cautious man;
a man who could, so to speak, counterbalance him,
retrieve his more serious mistakes, keep an eye on everything
he did or said, and in every case warn him in time
of the more grave eventualities. Can we label such a
device a crime? Or the sinister expression of a morbid
jealousy, as Tacitus would have us do? Was it not rather
the wise precaution of a cautious statesman, who did
not wish to rob an intelligent youth of the opportunities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
of distinguishing himself and of becoming proficient
in the government of a world which would, perhaps,
one day devolve upon him, though Tiberius was at the
same time anxious that the other’s inexperience should
not involve too much danger to the Empire and to
himself? But the wisest precautions are on occasions
the seed of disasters of the first magnitude.</p>

<p>And so they were in this case. In the year 18 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>,
Germanicus and Piso started, one after the other, at a
short interval of time, for the East, but they lost no
time in coming to loggerheads. The first incident
occurred at Athens, which first Germanicus, and then
Piso, made a stage in the journey. Germanicus, who
was an ardent admirer of Greek culture, had wished to
do honour in every possible way to the great city in
which the fire of ancient culture had burned with the
most dazzling brightness. He had entered Athens
almost like a private person, with only one lictor in
attendance; and had exchanged the most flowery and
amiable speeches with the magistrates of the city.
This attitude, however, had seemed too affable to a
Roman of the old stamp, like Piso, who considered that
the representative of the power of Rome ought never
to repose too great authority and confidence in the
subject nations and cities, even if they called themselves
Greece and Athens, and could pride themselves on
having listened to Socrates and on having been the first
to applaud the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides.
So Piso also stopped at Athens, but with the object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
of cancelling by a brusque and harsh demeanour the
impression which might have been made by the imprudent
affability of Germanicus. He, in his turn, made a
speech, full of stern reproof and almost veiled threats
to the Athenians, which seemed to everybody to be a
disavowal of the speeches of Germanicus; as if Piso
intended to convey to the people of Athens that Germanicus
had spoken on his own account and not in the
name of the Roman government.</p>

<p>Germanicus was an impressionable young man, but
really kind-hearted and conciliatory. He did not take,
in bad part, the kind of disavowal which Piso had inflicted
on him, all the more because he knew that Piso
was the mouthpiece of a perhaps harsh version of the
admonitions of Tiberius’s experienced wisdom. Round
Germanicus, however, there stood a large party of
flatterers and intriguers who had fixed on him as the
future emperor—Tiberius was already an old man—;
also, Germanicus had to wife Agrippina, a virtuous and
highly educated woman, who loved and admired him
intensely, but was at the same time very ambitious,
passionate, and uncritical, prone to mistake for just
and wise everything which appeased her ardent and not
ungenerous passions. Piso was accompanied to the
East by his wife, Plancina, a great friend of Livia,
Tiberius’s mother, and a great enemy of Agrippina.
The interested flatteries of friends, the fiery temperament
of Agrippina, her blind love for her husband, and
her hatred for Plancina, in a short time transformed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
into a violent personal conflict what Tiberius had
intended to be a discreet collaboration between a man
of ripe age and experience, and a young man full of
good intentions but at times lacking in ballast.</p>

<p>For the rest, the matters which Germanicus and Piso
had been sent to the East to settle were complicated
and difficult, and therefore afforded countless opportunities
and pretexts for quarrels. Rome found herself
involved in a grave difficulty in the East. Some years
before, the Parthians, left without a king, had sent to
Italy for Vonones, a son of their old King Phraates, who
had been educated in Rome at the house of Augustus.
To have at the head of the Parthian Empire a king who
had been educated on the banks of the Tiber was a
stroke of luck for Rome. The Parthians, however,
very soon discovered that Vonones had become too
much Latinised at Rome, and had forgotten too completely
the ideas and customs of his nation. Consequently,
they had turned him out and elected in his
stead Artabanus. Vonones had fled to Armenia, and
had succeeded in getting elected King of the Armenians.
But Artabanus, not wishing his predecessor to become
king of a vast empire marching with his own, from
which he might retrieve in due course the crown of the
Parthians, had succeeded also by means of various
intrigues and threats in getting Vonones expelled from
Armenia.</p>

<p>The difficulty which Tiberius had charged Germanicus
and Piso to study and resolve on the spot was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
actually this: whether Rome should or should not give
ear to Vonones’s clamour and replace him on the throne
of Armenia. The difficulty was a serious one, as each of
the two opposing courses promised grave dangers. By
replacing Vonones on the throne of Armenia, Rome
might implicate herself in serious quarrels, and perhaps
in a war, with the King of the Parthians, who was
opposed to Vonones’s restoration. By not replacing
him, Rome appeared to sacrifice to the hatred of the
Parthian King this faithful client of hers, whose only
fault was that he had been educated in Rome; to be
inclined to recognise that a prince who had been too
thoroughly Romanised could not govern an Oriental
state,—a confession which certainly would not encourage
the protected sovereigns of Asia, great and small,
to bring themselves too closely into touch with the
affairs, ideas, and customs of the protecting state. In
point of fact, Germanicus and Piso, who were already
embittered against each other by the incidents at
Athens, came into open conflict on this point. Germanicus
and his supporters were in favour of sacrificing
Vonones to the resentment of the King of the Parthians
and to the national susceptibilities of the East; while
Piso, more loyal to the authoritative traditions of
the old Roman policy, which were faithfully reflected in
his own more cautious judgment, decided to defend
Vonones. Rome must not abandon the cause of this
her faithful servant in the East!</p>

<p>Germanicus had, by virtue of a decree of the Senate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
supreme powers in the East; as a result his opinion
carried the day, notwithstanding all the efforts that
Piso made to prevent his sacrificing Vonones, whom
Piso by way of compensation entertained, treated with
honour, and openly took under his protection. Towards
the middle of the year 18, Germanicus crowned Zenon
King of the Armenians in Artaxata, a son of Polemon,
King of Pontus. When, however, Germanicus asked
Piso to send into Armenia a section of the legions placed
under his command, to make an armed demonstration
in favour of the new sovereign, Piso refused. Theoretically
and by virtue of the decrees of the Senate, Germanicus
had the right to give orders to Piso, and Piso
ought to have obeyed them. On the other hand,
Piso represented Tiberius; and with Germanicus, as
with every other human authority, it was not enough
to possess the power, there was needed also the hardihood
to use it. In the face of Piso’s energy and the
authority of Tiberius, who stood behind Piso, Germanicus
did not dare to insist.</p>

<p>It is easy, however, to picture the fury and rage of
Germanicus’s friends and flatterers, to whom this
kind of surveillance to which Germanicus was subjected
became more intolerable, the more it limited
indirectly their own authority. In their fury, they
determined to have their revenge, and they were not
long in finding an opportunity, though it cost them dear.
Artabanus, the King of the Parthians, encouraged by
the pliability of Germanicus, sent to ask him to forbid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
Vonones to live in Syria, on the ground that, as that
province bordered on his Empire, Vonones could easily
use it as a base from which to intrigue against him. In
view of the fact that Vonones was in Syria as the guest
of Piso, the Parthian King was asking Germanicus in
so many words to forbid Piso to protect him. The
demand was, in truth, excessive and somewhat humiliating
for Rome; but Germanicus’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entourage</i> saw in this
demand a means of humiliating Piso, and worked and
talked to such effect that Germanicus conceded to it
and shut Vonones up in a city in Cilicia. A checkmate
had been inflicted on Piso, but the price of it was a
humiliation for Rome. Piso and his party had good
reason for accusing Germanicus and his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entourage</i>
of compromising with singular levity the prestige of
Rome in the East.</p>

<p>At the end of the year 18, then, the conflict between
Germanicus, invested by a decree of the Senate with
the general governorship of the East and supported
by a numerous party of Tiberius’s opponents, and Piso,
who, as charged by Tiberius with the governorship
of Syria, the most important province in the East,
represented in the East the will of the Emperor, had
become so acute and violent as to upset in a most
dangerous manner the whole Eastern policy of Rome.
The conflict became still more grave in the following
year. At the beginning of the year 19, Germanicus,
who was an enlightened young man, and therefore
desirous of travelling and seeing the famous spots, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
monuments, and the customs of various nations, made
with Agrippina an extensive trip through Egypt, impelled
by curiosity to visit that ancient and celebrated
country, which even then exercised so mysterious a
fascination on the minds of the peoples of the West.</p>

<p>While he was on his way to see the Pyramids, however,
was interrogating the mysterious smile of the
Sphinx, and was cleaving the sacred stream of the Nile,
Piso profited by his absence to avenge himself for the
checkmate which he had suffered the year before on
Vonones’s account. Either on his own initiative, or, it
may be, because he had meanwhile received instructions
from Tiberius, Piso abolished or modified many of the
dispositions which Germanicus, by virtue of his extraordinary
powers, had made for Syria, the year before.
Imagine the fury of Germanicus, of Agrippina, and of
his friends and flatterers, on his return! Was this then
all the deference Piso paid to the decrees of the Senate
and of the authority conferred by them on Germanicus?
Did Piso think himself lord of the East, because he was
the friend and representative of Tiberius? On Germanicus’s
return there were some violent altercations
between him and Piso. This time, Germanicus,
impelled by passion, by the incitements of his flatterers,
and also by the fear of losing all authority in the eyes of
the province if he should yield once more, plucked up
courage to resort to extreme measures. In the exercise
of his extraordinary powers, he ordered Piso to give up
the governorship of the province which Tiberius had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
entrusted to him. This step, in view of the fact that
Piso was the representative of Tiberius, was a bold one,
but it was quite a legal one. In disobeying it, Piso was
obliged to assume an attitude of open defiance of the
laws. Since Germanicus had dared to make use of this
power, and on this occasion showed that he meant
business and was determined to carry the matter
through, it was Piso’s duty to give way and obey,
subject to the right of protest to Tiberius and of
obtaining from him just compensation for the affront
he had received.</p>

<p>Piso resigned his office and left the province; and
travelled at an easy rate in short stages towards Italy.
When he arrived at Seleucia, he was overtaken by the
news that Germanicus was seriously ill at Antioch. He
halted, waiting for new and more authentic news; which
arrived in a few days, and announced to him the young
man’s death. What was his illness? We do not know.
Untimely deaths were frequent in the family of
Augustus. It seemed as if many of the younger members
had not the strength to stand the life of drudgery
and fatigue to which he compelled them, by way of
preparation for the government of the Empire. However
that may be, Piso no sooner knew that Germanicus
was dead than he returned to Syria with the object of
re-occupying the province. How great, however, was
his surprise to learn that it had been decided
amongst the friends of Germanicus, after the latter’s
death, to entrust the command of the legions and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
government of the province to one of themselves,
Gnæus Senzius!</p>

<p>This nomination of Senzius was illegal—there can be
no doubt about that. With the death of Germanicus,
the extraordinary power by which he had momentarily
removed Piso from the province, himself assuming
its government, came to an end; therefore the province
and the command of the armed forces re-devolved
on Piso. The friends of Germanicus had no right or
power to nominate a substitute for him. But for what
reason had they arrived at so grave a decision? Germanicus
was surrounded in the East by many friends,
many admirers, and many flatterers, who had placed
their hopes in him, as the future emperor. His death
was, therefore, a disaster for the ambitions and aspirations
of many. On the other hand, it had been sudden,
unforeseen, and mysterious; a fact which, in times when
the causes and symptoms of illness were much less
easily recognised than they are at present, readily lent
itself to the engendering of suspicions, especially the
suspicion of poisoning, then so common and so easy.
Before the corpse of Germanicus had been burnt,
Agrippina and all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entourage</i> of the dead man’s
intimates were persuaded, and were stating openly,
that Germanicus had been poisoned,—and poisoned by
Piso in revenge. Hence arose the necessity of their
preventing Piso, even at the cost of a breach of the laws,
from re-occupying his province, in which they wished to
be left supreme, so as to be able to collect the proofs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
the crime of which Germanicus was the reported
victim. For instance, they imprisoned an old woman
called Martina, who was said to be an intimate friend
of Plancina, a witch by profession. Her they accused
of having supplied the poison, and of having sent it
to Rome.</p>

<p>When Piso first heard of the accusation, he did not
take it very seriously, and tried to force a re-entry into
the province from which his adversaries were illegally
excluding him. Perhaps he hoped that when he, the
legitimate pro-consul, presented himself, the oppositions,
which the others pretended to be ready to make,
would fade away. In this he was disappointed. Gnæus
Senzius resisted, a few insignificant skirmishes took
place, and a civil war on a small scale was about to
begin. The prospect, however, frightened both sides,
and, not wishing that so small a matter of principle
should result in a real civil war, both parties—Piso, Senzius,
and the friends of Germanicus—agreed to go in a
body to Rome and to submit the question to the
Emperor. And so they did.</p>

<p>When, however, they arrived, they found Italy and
Rome in an incredible state of agitation. Germanicus
was most popular, not only because he was really
attractive to a great many people, but because everybody
in his admiration and sympathy for him vented
the discontent and repulsion which the rough character
and iron policy of Tiberius inspired in one. The
popular voice had gone so far as to say that Germanicus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
had made up his mind to restore, when he became
Emperor, the republic of ancient times in every detail,
and that Tiberius on this account suspected and hated
him! Not only, then, was his premature death bitterly
lamented by everybody; but the explanation which his
friends gave of it—that Germanicus had died of poison
by the contrivance of Piso—was immediately accepted
as true, evident, and proved. Even at the present day,
the masses are easily convinced of tales of crimes and
poisonings. Imagine how it must have been in those
days! And the desire for vengeance followed hard on
the general feeling of grief and horror. The wish was
expressed on all sides that Piso should be given an
exemplary punishment; it was impossible to allow so
execrable a crime to go unpunished. Would some
noble friend of Germanicus, then, arise and revenge his
death? At the same time, other rumours, no less
fantastic, were being whispered from ear to ear. No;
the trial would never take place. Piso was secretly
protected by Tiberius, and Plancina by Livia. Nobody
would dare attack them!</p>

<p>The arrival of Agrippina, who, at the end of 19 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>,
reached Brindisi with Germanicus’s ashes; the transportation
of the ashes to Rome in the midst of the most
moving demonstrations of grief on the part of the
Italian cities; the solemn celebration of the funeral rites
in Rome, made the situation still more serious. Public
exasperation increased, not only against Piso, but also
against Tiberius. Tiberius and Livia had not taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
part in the funeral ceremonies for Germanicus at Rome;
the latter because she was too old and infirm, the former
because he had avoided recently as much as possible
investing family ceremonies with superfluous official
importance. The public, however, began to accuse
these two of not being at all displeased at the death of
Germanicus. Of course, that young man had always
given umbrage to Tiberius. Had not the latter recalled
him from Germany, so that he should not cover himself
with too much glory?</p>

<p>It was not long before even graver charges began to be
whispered about. Piso had arrived at Rome by way of
the Tiber, disembarking near the Tomb of the Cæsars,
the resting-place of the ashes of his victim, and with a
large retinue of friends had made an ostentatious
progress to his house above the Forum, where he had
given a great banquet. It was clear, then, that he had
no fears. He defied public opinion and the Courts.
And his attitude was justified, for he had acted on the
orders of Tiberius, and possessed a letter from him in
which these orders were given. That letter was his
shield of defence against every danger! In point of
fact, public suspicion was by now being diverted from
Piso against a higher target. It was being directed
straight against Tiberius and Livia. And Agrippina,
whom grief was robbing of the little sense which nature
had given her, added fuel to the enmities and suspicions
in the public and the Senate through her
lamentations, her recriminations, and her accusations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
which were as vehement as they were unfounded.</p>

<p>When at last, therefore, certain persons,—Fulcinius
Trio, Vitellius, and Veranius,—incited by public opinion,
by the friends of Germanicus, who cried for vengeance,
and by Agrippina, who would hear of no mercy,
decided to accuse Piso and Plancina of poison, as well as
Piso and his son Marcius of having tried to stir up civil
war, Tiberius found himself in a most grave dilemma.
It seems that trials such as these, involving persons of
the highest rank and acts of a political character, could
not be set in motion without the approval of the
Emperor, who had the additional privilege of deciding
whether the case should come before the ordinary tribunal,—the
jury, as in trials of Verres and Clodius,—or
whether he ought to entrust it instead to the Senate.
Tiberius did not believe in the imputation of poison,
which was the only really grave charge brought against
Piso,—the other charge, that of civil war, being more
in the nature of a second string. He did not believe in
the poison charge, just as no sensible and impartial
man believed in it, just as Tacitus, years later, did not
believe in it, even though, with his usual malice, he has
done all he could to induce posterity to accept it as
true. Tiberius did not believe in it, for not only was
there no proof of the charge itself, but it was in itself
absurd. In fact, the accusers, when forced to explain
when and in what way Piso had poisoned Germanicus,
had found themselves reduced to asserting that, at a
banquet to which Germanicus had invited Piso, and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
which Piso was seated at a considerable distance from
Germanicus, Piso, at a moment when Germanicus was
looking in another direction, had poured the poison into
his wine, actually in the midst of his host’s numerous
servants and in the presence of the guests! This story
may be taken as a sample of the whole accusation.
Tiberius then knew that the charge was a romance,
created and magnified by the political and partisan
enmities which amongst the Roman nobility were so
violent, by the credulity of the public, by the unreasoning
hatred the people felt towards himself and the
supreme authority with which he had been invested.
He would, therefore, gladly have cut the trial short at
the very beginning.</p>

<p>Could he do so, however? This Emperor, whom so
many inexperienced historians have represented as a
terrible despot, was in reality possessed of much less
power as head of the State than his present-day detractors
suppose. He was obliged to take into account
public opinion, however obtuse and mad it might be.
He was vaguely suspected of having prompted Piso
to poison Germanicus, or at least of having willingly
shut his eyes to the crime. If he prevented the charge
being brought, would not this be the strongest confirmation
of this mad calumny? Would not the whole
populace murmur in their anger that the unfortunate
Germanicus had been robbed, first of life, and then of
vengeance,—and by the man who was his adoptive
father? This, in the eyes of the ancients, constituted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
the gravest dereliction of family obligations. The trial
was a satisfaction which the public demanded; and
the Emperor—that pretended despot, lord of the whole
State—had not power enough to refuse it.</p>

<p>So Tiberius was forced to consent to the trial. Being,
however, a wise and level-headed man, he remitted it
to the Senate, the one of the two tribunals which might
be expected with greater reason to be enlightened and
serene. The other—the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quæstio</i>, or, as we should say,
the jury—was too closely in contact with public
opinion, and not likely to be able to exercise calm
judgment in a case in which public opinion was so
much excited and prejudiced against the principal
defendant. The Senate, on the contrary, was the
gravest body in the Republic, and might be expected
to rise superior to popular passions in the exercise of its
judicial functions. Nevertheless, even in the Senate,
the friends of Germanicus and the enemies of Tiberius
were to be found in force. Not only this, but a fierce
antipathy divided the ancient from the new nobility.
During the fifty years which followed the end of the
civil wars, many recently ennobled families had entered
the Senate. Amongst these, the families of ancient
nobility, those whose glory dated back to the grand era
of the Republic, at this time formed only a small yet
haughty minority, which lived apart, despised the new
nobility, and kept aloof as far as possible. Now Piso
belonged to one of these ancient families, and to one of
the most glorious of them. The constitution of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
Senate as the tribunal, meant, therefore, entrusting
the decision of the case to the new, upstart nobility,
which was full of blind rancour against the haughtiness
of the old families.</p>

<p>In any case there was no other tribunal; and between
the two evils, Tiberius could only choose the lesser.
However, he realised so clearly the gravity of the
dangers which surrounded the course of justice, in the
midst of so many frenzied passions, in this trial which
had been engineered by insensate hatreds and rancours,
that when, as president of the Senate, he had to open
the sessions, he made a speech, the gist of which Tacitus
has preserved for us. Whoever reads it cannot help
recognising the spirit of profound wisdom and equity
which inspires it. Tiberius explained quite clearly to
the Senate that the charge of poisoning levelled against
Piso, if true, would be an extremely serious matter.
He reminded them, however, that Piso was a prominent
man, who had rendered eminent services to the Republic
and belonged to one of the most ancient and noble
families in Rome. They must, therefore, bring the
most serene impartiality to bear on their judgment,
forgetting who was the accused, if they found him
guilty, forgetting who was the victim, if they found him
innocent. However great his affection for Germanicus
might be, nothing would induce him to wish for the
sacrifice on the latter’s tomb, of an innocent man, for
the satisfaction of the insensate mania for revenge
which had taken possession of the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>

<p>The speech was a wise and humane one; but what
could sober words, even from an Emperor’s mouth,
avail when passions are aroused? The Senate allotted
two days to the prosecution, three to the defence.
There was to be an interval of six days between the
two sections of the trial. For two whole days, the
accusers talked, reconstructing, as Cicero had done
in Verres’s case, the whole history of Piso’s life. They
went so far as to accuse him of having misgoverned the
previous provinces he had had; they went minutely into
the history of his government in Syria, and repeated
the fantastic story of the poisoning. Tacitus himself
recognised that the charges were very weak, especially
the accusation of poisoning, which was the only serious
one. Accordingly, the first impression made by the trial
was very uncertain. The public was prejudiced in
favour of the prosecution; in the Senate there was a
strong party hostile to Piso. After all, however, the
Senate was a great political body, and many of its
members could not but recognise that the charges were
slender ones. Everybody felt that the issue depended
on Tiberius, who could, according as he showed himself
favourable or the reverse, weigh down the scales on the
side of acquittal or of conviction. Everybody, therefore,
looked towards him, with hope or with anxiety.
But Tiberius listened to the prosecution without moving
an eyelid, as impassive as a statue, without allowing a
glimpse into his secret thoughts on the subject. Could
he act otherwise? If he had shown himself favourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
to Piso, he would have been accused of shielding the
murderers of Germanicus, through hatred of his adopted
son or even through actual complicity in the crime.
He could not and would not attach himself, however, to
the mob which cried for Piso’s head, innocent or guilty.
He was too haughty and too serious a man to descend to
such baseness. Recognise that public opinion was a
force of which account must be taken,—this he was
prepared to do; pander to it like a slave, at the cost of
honour and justice,—no.</p>

<p>Rarely had a Roman Emperor found himself placed,
by the suspicions of the public, by the mad passions of
the people, by the perfidious malevolence of the cabals
and <em>coteries</em>, in a more difficult position. The six days
that elapsed between the prosecution and the defence
must have been thorny days for Tiberius. Inasmuch
as a nod from him could weigh down the scales, both
parties tried to influence him. Piso and his friends
worked to induce him and Livia to make up their minds
to intervene openly in the Senate on behalf of outraged
innocence. The other side endeavoured to frighten
him. They accused Tiberius <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sotto voce</i> of having
favoured Piso unjustly in his speech to the Senate, in
which he had already assumed the charge of poisoning
to be untrue. They circulated the story of the compromising
letter in Piso’s possession which the latter
threatened to read in the Senate, if Tiberius did not
help him. Meanwhile Agrippina was filling Rome
with her lamentations and imprecations, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
public agitation was increasing. Cries were heard on
every side that Germanicus must be avenged. Piso’s
position was tragic. But Tiberius would not depart
from the line of conduct, that of impartiality, which
he had marked out for himself—hoping, perhaps, that
the trial would furnish him sooner or later with an
opportunity of preserving justice without laying himself
open to suspicions of too debasing a nature. He
allowed Livia, however, to interest herself openly in
behalf of Plancina against whom also charges were
levelled; and Livia’s intervention might be indirectly
of service to Piso, as it made it clear, to those who cared
to see, that Germanicus’s own grandmother did not
believe in the charge of poisoning.</p>

<p>Piso was an energetic man. Confident in the justice
of his case, he reappeared in the Senate when, after
the lapse of six days, the sessions again began; and
defended himself in a clever, energetic, and resolute
speech. He seems to have been especially happy in the
way in which he shattered the charge of poisoning.
He demanded that his own slaves, and those belonging
to Germanicus who had been present at the famous
banquet at which it was suggested that he had put
poison in the dead man’s wine, should be put to the
torture. The speech made a lively impression, and
would probably have saved Piso, had not serious disorders
broken out in Rome while he was speaking in the
Senate. An immense popular demonstration invaded
the precincts of the Senate, while he was speaking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
howling for his execution, and crying that, if the Senate
acquitted him, they had serious thoughts of avenging
Germanicus by lynching the judges. A section burst
into the Forum, overturned the statues, and made as if
to drag them away to the Gemoniæ and to break them
in pieces. It was found necessary to send Piso to his
house with an escort of soldiers, in order to save him
from violence.</p>

<p>What was the origin of these demonstrations? Were
they the natural explosion of popular passion, fed by the
ready credulity of the masses? Were they stirred up by
the enemies of Tiberius and Piso, to impress the hesitating
section of the Senate? We shall never know.
All that is certain is that, by the evening of the day on
which these demonstrations took place, nobody in Rome,
least of all the accused, was any longer under the delusion
that Piso could be acquitted of the charge, however
absurd and unjust it might be. The Senate, weakened by
so many internal dissensions and by so many civil wars,
was no longer a strong enough assembly to dare resist
this mad fury on the part of the masses. By evening,
Piso had lost all heart and had already made up his
mind to give up the struggle. But his sons gathered
round him and put into him fresh courage. Renewed
efforts were made to induce Tiberius to oppose his
authority to the torrent of calumny and insensate hate.
Had Tiberius left room for one glimmer of light? or did
Piso’s sons and friends delude themselves and delude
him? It is certain that next day Piso again plucked up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
courage and returned to the Senate, where he continued
his defence, parrying and countering fresh attacks,
with his eyes ever fixed on Tiberius, the man who more
than anyone else was persuaded of his innocence, and
from whom a word might be so useful to him. Tiberius,
however, did not dare pronounce that word. Surrounded
as he was by so many enemies and suspicions,
not even he—the lord of the world, as the historians
call him—felt himself strong enough to engage in open
duel with the public opinion of Rome and the majority
in the Senate. So, when he perceived that Tiberius
himself could not or would not help him, Piso abandoned
the struggle. Returning home that evening,
he anticipated his certain conviction by committing
suicide during the night.</p>

<p>The public had gained their victim, to comfort them
in their grief for the premature loss of Germanicus.
The enemies of Piso were, however, not content, and
proposed that the name of Piso be erased from the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fasti</i>, and that the half of his goods be confiscated; that
his son Marcus be imprisoned for ten years, only
Plancina, out of regard for Livia, being allowed to go
unpunished. But Tiberius judged that the blood of
Piso was expiation enough for a crime which nobody
had committed; and, since the public had had their
bloody satisfaction, he intervened openly, and, by
virtue of his authority, prevented the erasure of Piso’s
name from the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fasti</i>, as well as the confiscation of his
goods and the condemnation of his son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

<p>The trial of Piso was one of the most savage of all the
judicial dramas in Roman history. The trial of Clodius
had been a comedy, that of Verres a tragi-comedy, that
of Piso was pure tragedy and terrible tragedy. For it
was an episode in the gradual extermination of the old
and glorious Roman nobility, which was being brought
about by the new social forces which, during the years
of peace, had grown up under the shadow of the imperial
authority. How sad a spectacle are these trials which
from time to time recur in history! The penal law
ought to be the sacred instrument of justice, which
punishes the wrong-doers, and defends and comforts the
good citizens. The world is, however, full of wicked
passions; and wicked passions find fertile soil in political
parties, social classes, and public opinion—that vague
power which has come so much to the fore in the last
hundred years. These evil passions, from time to time,
seize hold of the instruments of justice, and convert
them into instruments of torment and persecution for
the torture, the defamation, and the extermination of
the innocent, for whom there is no way of escape, no
refuge, and no pity.</p>

<p>These trials prove one thing,—a truth which perhaps
the modern world, in which the power of public opinion
has increased so much, ought always to bear in mind.
And that is, that the stronger public opinion is in a
state, the more necessary it is for that state to have an
unperturbed, independent, enlightened judicature,
armed with a vigorous and clear doctrine of justice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
backed by a powerful government, which can hold its
own against the most violent gusts of public opinion,
and execute real justice in the teeth of the crooked
malevolence of the masses. Otherwise justice can only
too easily degenerate into a kind of tragic farce.</p>

<p>“Αριστον ὕδωρ,” says Pindar. “Water is good,” as
it is often translated. But why should a hymn in
honour of a victor in the games begin with a sentiment
which would be much better suited to an anti-alcoholic
league? ὕδωρ here does not mean water;
it is the corresponding word to the Latin <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sudor</i>, which
means sweat,—the symbol of the physical effort made
by the athlete. “Excellent is sweat,” that is to say,
the effort made by the victor in training himself and in
winning an arduous victory.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Speech delivered at the opening of the Congress of the Psychology
of Sport at Lausanne, May 6, 1913.</p>

</div>

<p>Αριστον ὕδωρ, then, says the clarion voice of one of the
noblest sons of Greece, the great poet who, in honour
of the sport of his times, has clothed in lyric poetry the
dazzling myths of Hellenic polytheism. The motto
has travelled down the ages, and we, too, are assembled
here to interpret it after the fashion of our times. Is
it not inevitable that the speech I have to make should
be merely a development of this undying theme,
ἄριστον ὕδωρ? And yet you would be justified in
asking why this task should devolve on this occasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
upon a man who spends his whole life in plying a tool—the
pen—which is too light to convince him of the
truth of Pindar’s apothegm. It is true that there was a
time when he who has the honour of addressing you was
not yet an examiner of historical documents nor a
student of philosophical problems; when he was, on the
contrary, an ardent gymnast. I will even confess to
you that the first time his name appeared in the newspapers,
it was in the accounts of gymnastic and athletic
meetings, in connection with which some amiable reporters
thought it proper to comment on his squirrel-like
agility. But those times are, alas! long past.
The over-violent passion for physical exercises which
was his between the ages of ten and fifteen years obliged
him suddenly to drop them. He has allowed his
muscles gradually to be invaded and eaten up by that
physical laziness which enervates so many thinkers
of the present day, and which upsets the balance of
their bodily forces.</p>

<p>You see, then, that these far-distant memories
cannot give me authority to claim a right, however
small, to address you on this occasion. I am a stranger
in this world of sport, which has developed so rapidly
in the last thirty years. I have followed only at a
distance the movement which has given it birth, and I
should find myself in great difficulties if I had to
discuss in its details one of the numberless questions
attaching to this form of contemporary activity.
What authority, then, have I for addressing you on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
occasion? None. And the kindness which Baron de
Coubertin has shown in honouring me with an invitation
to address you, though most flattering to me, cannot
fill the void left by manifest incompetence for the
task. You will tell me that I should have done better
to remember the wise advice Homer gave the cobbler,
and to refuse this honour of which I was not worthy.
And you will be right. But I would excuse myself by
telling you first of all that it is difficult to refuse anything
to so distinguished and amiable a man and to so
ardent an advocate of the causes he makes his own as
M. de Coubertin. Secondly, if I am a sportsman who
long ago has made his final exit, I am also a man who
tries, as far as his feeble wits will allow him, to understand
that life outside himself in which he can take no
immediate and direct part.</p>

<p>Is not that the rôle, and in a certain sense the obsession,
of the historian? The historian must understand
all the forms and phenomena of life; crimes, intrigues,
battles, wars, revolutions, loves, hatreds, perfidies,
the hidden weaknesses of great men, the blind impulses
of the masses, the noblest and the basest sentiments
which actuate the human mind. If we were required
to have experienced everything that we are required to
understand, the profession of historian would be
the most difficult and the most dangerous in the
world; for, in order to qualify, a man would have at
least to run the risk of the galleys or of the
scaffold. Without a doubt, this necessity of understanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
all the forms of the life outside is also one of
the great weaknesses of historians. Often they make
mistakes; even more often, the picture they give of
things seems but pale by contrast with the living reality,
to those who have actually lived that reality. I am
quite sure that this will be my fate, if I talk to you about
things which you know better than do I. That, however,
is the inevitable drawback of the profession, and
I shall go through with my task, relying on your kind
indulgence.</p>

<p>I shall talk to you, then, about sport in modern life
as a man who has considered it from outside. I shall
philosophise awhile about sport, if you will allow me;
for to philosophise about a thing is often a polite way
of talking about a thing regarding which the speaker
has little knowledge to people whose knowledge regarding
it is considerable. And I will ask myself this
question: What is and what ought to be the function
of sport in modern society? What is its rôle, and what
are its limits? Put thus, the question is but a particular
form of a more general question which philosophers
have long been asking themselves: What is the
mutual and reciprocal rôle of the different human
activities? It is a well-known truth that with the
advances of civilisation social life undergoes an inward
process of differentiation. Commerce separates from
industry, industry from war, war from government,
government from the intellectual activities, which in
their turn become specialised,—art, science, religion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
etc. We get professions, corporations, institutions, and
classes corresponding to all these different activities;
men, that is to say, who have passions, ambitions,
desires, needs, and interests, and who quickly come into
conflict with one another. What parts ought to be
allowed to all these different activities? Which is
the most necessary, the most noble, and the most
exalted? Which ought to be surrounded with the
greatest respect, covered with the greatest honours,
and recompensed with the most considerable rewards?</p>

<p>Men have answered this question in countless different
ways. It is, however, easy to discover in many of
these answers a common tendency that is a proneness
to consider as first and all-important the corporation,
profession, or institution to which each inquirer belongs.
A savant is easily convinced that the end of life is the
search after the truth. In his eyes, the universe must
exist only in order that men of science may discover its
laws and its secrets. For artists, on the other hand,
the world has been created to enable them to adorn it
with pictures, statues, or buildings. For the soldier
war is the end of existence, while the merchant sees in
commerce the beneficent force which makes the world
go round. And so on. All these theories seem sober
fact to those who formulate them; unfortunately the
others, those who belong to a different class or profession,
reject them as absurd and ridiculous errors.</p>

<p>How are the various views to be reconciled? A certain
number of philosophers have tried to raise themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
above these too narrow or too biassed points of
view, and to find solutions of general value. Many
have been proposed; now is not the time to discuss the
principal ones. So I will confine myself to expounding
to you that one of these theories which seems to me
the simplest, the most ingenious, and the most useful
for the resolution of the problem which we have set
ourselves in connection with sport. It is the theory
of the limits. All human activities ought to be
reciprocal limits.</p>

<p>Take art and morality for instance: What relation
ought they to bear to each other? The question has
been discussed with ardour. Artists, and many of
their friends, have tried to postulate a violent schism
between the two, proclaiming that art has the right to
search for beauty wherever she can find it, without
bothering herself about morality. Super-moralists, on
the contrary, have tried to make art the slave of
morality, asserting that the former ought to be always
ready to obey its orders and to sacrifice herself to its
demands. But would it not be more reasonable and
more human to say that art and morality are reciprocal
limits? Morality is one of art’s limits; without wishing
to make her its slave, it can and must prevent her from
seeking beauty in certain subjects and certain incidents
which would be dangerous to morals or to the pure-mindedness
of the public. The forms of beauty are so
numerous. Why should not art refrain for moral reasons
from seeking for some of them? But art on her side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
is a limit of morality; she is in no way anxious to dominate
it, but she can and must prevent morality from
going astray in its search for perfection. Those who
are familiar with history know that a spice of artistic
taste has always been the best remedy for the
most dangerous or the most repugnant excesses of
asceticism.</p>

<p>Let us take another example. A question which has
much exercised men’s minds is whether art and science
ought to set before themselves practical ends, or whether
they are in themselves ends. There are people who
would like to subordinate the rest of the world to art
and to science. This entails requiring of art and
science that they should seek beauty and truth without
having in view any utilitarian end, without troubling
themselves to ask whether they are useful or hurtful to
man. Others again propose to subordinate art and
science to the rest of the world, asserting that every
art and every science which does not serve practical
ends is a waste of time and trouble. Here, too, it
seems to me that it would be more human to say that
science and art seek truth and beauty, not utility.
Utility, then, is not the end of art and of science;
but it is one of their limits. The truths which the
human mind can discover, like the forms of beauty
which it can create, are infinite.</p>

<p>Is it strange, then, that man, unable to discover all
the truths or to create all the forms of beauty, should
choose for preference those which, in addition to conferring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
intellectual or æsthetic pleasure, help him to
live? Can anyone see anything absurd in this? If a
man set to work to build edifices with the sole object of
pleasing the eye through harmonious lines, he could
build them as fancy prompted him; there would be no
limit either to the variety of forms or to the number of
different constructions. Will anybody be found to
maintain that art has the right to fill the world with
beautiful edifices which are of no use for anything?
No, practical considerations have their claim. Even
the epochs in which architecture flourished most bravely
built edifices which, while beautiful to look at, served
also definite ends; and nobody has ever protested
against the limitations which this practical consideration
imposed.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Similarly sport must, in my opinion, be considered
as a limit; the limit necessary to the excesses of an
intellectual and sedentary civilisation, which exposes
the nervous system to formidable trials. M. de Coubertin
has analysed this aspect of modern life so well in his
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Essais de psychologie sportive</i>, that I beg leave to quote
one of the numerous fine passages from that book:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p  xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La vie moderne n’est plus ni locale ni spéciale; tout y
influe sur tout. D’une part la rapidité et la multiplicité
des transports ont fait de l’homme un être essentiellement
mobile, pour le quel les distances sont de plus en plus insignifiantes
à franchir et sollicitent, par conséquent, de fréquents
changements de lieu; d’autre part l’égalisation des points
de départ et la possibilité d’élévations rapides vers le pouvoir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
et la fortune ont excité les appétits et les ambitions
des masses à un point inconnu jusqu’ ici.... Ce double
élément a transformé de façon fondamentale l’effort
humain. L’effort d’autre-fois était régulier et constant; une
certaine sécurité résultant de la stabilité sociale, le protégeait.
Surtout, il n’était pas cérébral a un degré excessif.
Celui d’aujourd’hui est tout autre. L’inquiétude et
l’espérance l’environnent avec une intensité particulière.
C’est que l’échec et la réussite ont dé nos jours des conséquences
énormes. L’homme peut à la fois tout craindre
et tout espérer. De cet état de chose est née une agitation
que les transformations de la vie extérieure encouragent et
accroissent. Au dedans et au dehors le cerveau est entretenu
dans une sorte d’ébullition incessante. Les points de
vue, les aspects des choses, les combinaisons, les possibilités,
tant pour les individus que pour les collectivités, se succèdent
si rapidement qu’il faut pour en tenir compte et les utilises
au besoin se tenir toujours en éveil et comme en une
mobilisation permanente.</p>
</div>

<p>This picture of modern life is perfect. Never has
man lived in such a state of permanent and growing
excitement. If the men of the ancient world could
come to life again, their first impression, you may be
sure, would be that mankind had gone mad. It is this
excitement which has produced the formidable explosion
of energy that we are witnessing on our little planet,
which for ages had lived in comparative tranquillity.
But has not this formidable tension of the world-soul
itself need of limits? Can we conceive its being allowed
to increase indefinitely until the time when the nervous
system breaks down as inevitably it must? Can we
conceive our perpetual agitation being left without any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
limit save exhaustion, insanity, or death? The question
answers itself. The limits to the over-excitement of
our nerves raise one of the most serious problems of our
epoch; a problem with a thousand different aspects,
which involves morals as well as hygiene, politics as
well as the intellectual life. Now sport may be one of
these limits, if it be practised—again I borrow from M.
de Coubertin—with calmness, “<span  xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">s’il devient cet empire
du Matin Calme d’où les deux vampires de notre
civilisation—la hâte et la foule—sont chassés</span>”; if it
be made, not one more in the long list of causes of
excitement and exhaustion, but a health-giving diversion,
a beneficent force capable of spraying the nerves
with that divine ambrosia, now so rare and so precious—healthy
sleep and peace of mind. No one who is
convinced of the supreme necessity for limits can doubt
that this conception of sport is the truest, worthiest,
and most beneficial; indeed, the only one that is in its
turn susceptible of a limit and runs no risk of losing itself
in excesses,—those excesses of sport, in its quality
of spectacle for the masses, whose brutalising and
corrupt effects are notorious.</p>

<p>A balancing force, a counterpoise to the intellectual
excesses of a sedentary, nervous civilisation which is
agitated by a perpetual excitement, that is what sport
ought to be. I hasten to add that I cannot claim the
credit for this definition, not that it is in itself a very
striking discovery. An opponent might even say that
it is almost a platitude; a special application of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
principle which is as old as the hills, and which the
Greeks expressed in their formula, μηδὲν ἅγαν, nothing
in excess. Granted; but it is sometimes a good
thing to repeat platitudes, for human wisdom is not
an inexhaustible mine of ever-new principles and ideas.
Its treasure-house is stored with platitudes, which have
only become such because man is always requiring their
repetition. Besides, when questions touching moral
and social life are under discussion, the intellectual
point of view is not by any means the most important.
Those principles of wisdom which seem the easiest
and simplest to announce are not those which are always
the simplest in practice, and the easiest to carry into
execution. μηδὲν ἅγαν—nothing in excess—has been
to men the cry of wisdom since the beginning of time.
Is it not the clearest and the simplest of principles?
Need one be a profound philosopher to understand that
moderation in the use of everything, even of good things,
is necessary? This truth is indeed one which the
simplest mind is capable of understanding. Yet life
is but an eternal struggle against excesses of all sorts, to
which man is continually tempted to give way. Why?
Because though the precept be clear and evident, to
apply it man has to struggle with his passions, with his
own interests, and those of others, and with the illusions
and errors that assail him on all sides. Consequently,
he must be under no illusion.</p>

<p>You are at one in a conception of sport which is the
noblest and wisest possible, because it regards sport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
as a balancing force between the diverse elements of
social life. You band together and join forces in order
to popularise this conception. It is a useful and a wise
task; but it will expose you to wearisome struggles, and
you must be prepared for many a bitter disappointment.
In every epoch, those who have wished to
introduce equilibrium into life have had to struggle
against this mysterious force which drives men into
every excess. But in no epoch and in no civilisation
perhaps has this struggle been so difficult and wearisome
as it is in contemporary civilisation. It is a
phenomenon which few people nowadays take clearly
and precisely into account; but which is, nevertheless,
the keystone of the greatest difficulties by which our
civilisation is beset. Yes, there is no doubt about it, we
are living at an extraordinary crisis in history. Man
has never been so powerful, so wise, so rich, so sure of
himself and of his future. He has dared to lift his eyes
and gaze steadily at the sombre mystery of things,
before which he had for so many centuries bowed his
head in trembling. He has conquered the world and
torn from it its most recondite treasures. He has cast
aside all the supports which sustained our ancestors in
their toilsome march through life—traditions, religions,
beliefs, all the principles of unquestioning obedience.
He had succeeded to a certain degree in conquering
space and time. All the civilisations which preceded the
French Revolution seem, if we compare them with ours,
small, limited, timid, poor, and inadequate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<p>Yet modern man does not seem to have any very
distinct and sure consciousness of his actual greatness.
He may be elated by an occasional fit of glowing pride,
but as often as not he is discontented. He grumbles;
he sincerely deplores the vices and imperfections of his
day. A broad and deep current of pessimism flows
through the fabulous wealth and the wonders of our
times. Why? Because our civilisation is by the very nature
of its constitution unable to thrive save on excesses;
and it can thrive only on excesses because it has acquired
so much power by overturning nearly all the limits within
which previous civilisations had confined themselves.</p>

<p>How marvellous an epic, but how disquieting in its
novelty and its grandeur, is this gradual awakening of
human daring and pride, of which the history of the last
four centuries is full! For its first appearance dates
back to the great geographical discoveries of the
fifteenth century, and to that which was the greatest
of all those discoveries—America.</p>

<p>A few years later saw the astronomic revolution.
Ancient thought, after long deliberation, had decided to
enclose the universe in a confined system, with established
limits. Copernicus took no notice of these limits,
and launched out in thought into the infinite. The
impression produced on the men of the sixteenth century
by these two great events was profound. The
bold spirits who had dared to cross the two limits considered
insuperable on earth and in the sky had come
back with a rich booty of land and stars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p>Was the world then greater and man more powerful
than the ancients had thought, and had the ancients
been wrong in seeking to limit the efforts of human
genius so strictly? Gradually, during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, the effort of the human spirit
to free itself from the ancient limits continued, increased,
and became bolder and more methodical. Subtle and
ingenious philosophies delivered masked but clear
attacks on the limits which marked the bounds of
Good and Evil, Truth and Error; on tradition, on
century-old institutions, on authority in all its forms.
They pretended to wish to ascertain whether the limits
were solidly planted in the right place; but in reality
they undermined their foundations. Little by little an
idea crept into men’s minds, an idea which was the
negation of all the limits within which the world had
lived until then; an idea which was bound to upset the
conception of social and moral life; the idea of liberty,
applied to religion, culture, and politics. At the same
time, by means of science and fire, man sought very
timidly, if not to free himself from, at least to enlarge,
the limits which nature seemed to have set to his forces.
The strata of coal began to be discovered and
exploited. Men set themselves to invent machines
more complicated and more rapid than those of which
their fathers made use; the steam-engine, the fountainhead
of all the formidable agitation which has
invaded the world, made its appearance; the great
era of iron and of fire began. And lo! finally a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
formidable cataclysm, of which man had never seen
the like in a few years, upset traditions, and wrought
havoc amongst states, institutions, and old-established
laws. To the strains of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Marseillaise</i>, on
the ruins of the Bastile, on the fields of Marengo and
Austerlitz, the work sketched out by Columbus and
Copernicus, continued by Galileo, Descartes, Voltaire,
Rousseau, and Kant, was completed. Man arose,
tore up, and overturned all the ancient limits and
planted the new ones with his own hands, at his own
good pleasure, not only for himself but also for the
authorities of Heaven and earth, who had until then
imposed their limits upon him.</p>

<p>Then began the extraordinary drama of which we
are the spectators. Rich, wise, and free, armed with
fire and science, mistress of a large part of the earth
and, in particular, of a continent so vast and rich as
America, irked no longer by any limit, not by extent
nor by weight nor by matter and its laws which it has
conquered, thanks to discoveries and to machines, nor
by God, whom it has banished to the infinite, itself
usurping His earthly throne, our civilisation expanded
in every direction, as it were, carried away by the intoxication
of the unlimited. Man rose erect like a giant,
to face nature and the past; and like a giant whom
none can resist he swept on and conquered the world.</p>

<p>Like a giant, indeed, but like a giant who totters at
every step. This civilisation of ours has become so
powerful because it has overturned all the limits; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
just because it has overturned nearly all the limits, it
has become increasingly difficult for it to limit itself
in the good as well as in the bad; I mean to say, that the
bad tends to become worse, and the good to become bad.
If the strength of the forces of creation and initiative is
in our epoch greater than ever it was in any previous
epoch, the same may be said of the weakness of the forces
of equilibrium, whose function it is to check the most
dangerous exaggerations and excesses. What an
interesting comparison might be made between the
present and the past from this point of view; and how
many instances could be cited in proof of this assertion!
I shall instance just one, a simple and homely,
but clear, one. Once delivered from all the bonds which
limited his efforts of yore, man has succeeded in the
last century in creating an abundance of material
goods such as the world had never thought possible
even when it dreamed of the Terrestrial Paradise, the
Golden Age, and the Garden of the Hesperides; all of
them myths in which man had been pleased, during
centuries of the life of struggle, to objectify his most
ardent desires. It is all very well for men of the present
day to complain that life is difficult and full of struggles.
Those who know the difficulties which beset preceding
centuries will feel a strong temptation to laugh at their
complaints. The modern world has contrived abundance
in everything; in the necessities of life, such as
bread, and in things which become very dangerous
when they are over-abundant, like alcoholic drinks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
tobacco, and all stimulants. Many are the reproaches
hurled against our epoch on the score of the increase in
alcoholism; many are the remedies devised for this evil.
But would not the only and the simplest remedy be
that adopted by our ancestors, the limitation of the
production of liquors? The masses would no longer
be able to poison themselves when the quantity of
these liquors was scarcely sufficient—as it used to be—for
the requirements of a moderate consumption.
The world, on the contrary, will continue to get gloriously
drunk, so long as the production of wine, beer,
and spirits increases. Now why is it that this, the
only efficacious remedy, is just the one which our
epoch cannot bring itself to apply? Why do we see
everywhere governments taking measures of more or
less efficacy against alcoholism and at the same time
contributing, directly or indirectly, to the increase in
the production of alcoholic drinks?</p>

<p>The reason is, that nothing is more difficult for our
civilisation than to impose a limit on anything. Its
impetus carries it too far in everything. It is almost
a law of its constitution. We have, to a great extent,
lost the sense of just measure, because we have weakened
or destroyed nearly all the authorities and moral
forces which used to make the limits respected. Our
greatness and our power are partly due to disequilibrium;
and often enough we are called on to pay the
tragic penalty for this at the moment when we least
expect the call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span></p>

<p>This is, however, a long digression, and you may with
reason ask me to return to the matter which interests
us. I have not lost sight of it; for this digression has a
very close connection with our subject.</p>

<p>This epoch which misuses everything, misuses and
will misuse sport. It will make it—it has already
begun to make it—one more of the elements of excitement,
of competition, and of exhaustion, already alas!
only too numerous. No illusions are possible on this
score. It might even be said that sport is one of the
things of which our epoch will probably make the
greatest misuse. History justifies us in this fear, for
it proves to us that even those civilisations, like the
Greek and Roman, which succeeded in limiting themselves
in everything else, misused games. Is it likely
that our civilisation, which misuses toilsome activities
like work, will easily preserve a just measure in amusements?
Besides, you have only to look round you to
see interests forming groups, coalitions, and organisations
for the purpose of exploiting, in this field also,
the morbid need for excitement which has taken hold
of the masses; their desire for amusements and distractions
and even their incorrigible weakness for
games of chance. Those, then, who wish to purge sport
of its elements of haste and crowd, to transform it—I
borrow once more M. de Coubertin’s happy phrase—into
the “Empire du Matin Calme,” will have a
singularly difficult task before them. If, however, the
task is difficult, it is for that all the nobler. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
modern world has need, great and urgent need, of balance,
measure, and harmony, if it is not to run the risk
of being stifled by the excess of its energy. Do not let
yourselves be deceived by its assurance, its pride, the
blind confidence in its powers which it affects, the
haughty challenge it so often throws to the humble
wisdom of past generations. We are richer, wiser, more
powerful than were our grandfathers. But because we
have discovered America and invented railways we
have not become demi-gods; we are still only men.
All the weaknesses of human nature which the moralists
of olden times discovered and analysed so subtly still
subsist in us, and still distract us; we must pay nature,
the great equaliser, the price for the advantages secured
to us by the sum of the work of preceding generations;
and many are the forms in which that payment is made.
Nervous illnesses, insanity, and suicides are on the
increase. Sterility is spreading, especially in the
peoples and countries that have been most highly
favoured by the development of modern civilisation.</p>

<p>A discontent as deep as it is unreasonable seems to
pervade the world, with each improvement in the
conditions of every class. One might say that man has
become insatiable. The more blessings are heaped
upon him, the more he complains. The more he
possesses, the more he thinks himself poor and needy.
The fewer are the causes for grief and the dangers
around him, the more wretched he feels. These
apparent paradoxes, these inexplicable contradictions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
are only the warnings life utters to remind men of the
μηδὲν ἅγαν of ancient wisdom. The modern world suffers
from the excesses to which it abandons itself,
even if it will not acknowledge this fact. Those who
try to recall the modern world to a more harmonious
ideal of life do it a service whose usefulness is most
strikingly proved by the attitude of resentment it
assumes towards their efforts.</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: I feel somewhat ashamed
that my contribution to your work must be merely
these few general considerations. Dissertations on
the ends to be aimed at are easy enough to concoct,
but the task is apt to be a theoretical one
of little enough utility. The important thing in all
the great social problems is the means of attaining
those ends. That is the point upon which all our
efforts, all our intelligence, all our wills, must converge.
I cannot be of any use to you in that, by
reason of my incompetence. I can only attend this
congress as an onlooker anxious to learn, come not to
purvey information but to convey it away. I must
then confine myself at the conclusion of my speech to
wishing your task and your labours all the success
which your energy, your enthusiasm, and your faith
deserve. But this wish of mine, though sterile in
itself, owing to my inability to take an active part in
your work, is none the less cordial. By birth, by
natural tendencies, and by education, I belong to a
culture which has always tended to harmony, moderation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
and equilibrium. I have passed a portion of my
life in studying the ancient civilisations which created
so many beautiful and profound things because they
succeeded in limiting themselves. I have visited and
studied also those vast new civilisations on the other
side of the Atlantic, which seem to be aiming at
the realisation of the perfect type of the unlimited
civilisation.</p>

<p>It is not possible to have been born in Italy, to have
studied ancient civilisations, and to have examined
at first hand the tendencies of modern civilisation in
Europe and America, without being convinced that our
epoch is allowing itself to be seduced by too material
and gross a conception of progress. Progress cannot be
merely the accumulation of wealth, accelerated by the
inventions and great discoveries of science, nor the
hurried transformation of everything, the perpetual
change which is the mania of our epoch. There is,
there must be, another conception, more lofty than
this conception of progress; a conception of progress as
the accumulated effort of generations. Is it not true
that each generation creates forms of beauty, and
discovers new truths and virtues? Can we not say that
generations really do show progress, if they succeed in
preserving the creations of preceding epochs, and in
erecting on them as a basis more complex and elevated
creations of their own?</p>

<p>Often and often, reflecting on the differences between
the ancient world and our epoch, have I said to myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
that the history of the world would be able to chronicle
a great step forward on the day that we succeeded in
uniting in modern sport the æsthetic sense of the
Greeks, the modesty and decency for which Christianity
is responsible, and the democratic, practical,
and active spirit of our epoch. Is that simply the
dream of an ignoramus who does not know what is
possible and what is not? You may say so. But if
your congress can bring our civilisation any nearer to
this ideal, it will have done something for real progress,
a work which will merit the approbation of all those
who wish to see man’s every effort concentrated on the
betterment of the spiritual life. I give you then, my
good wishes for your success in your efforts in this
direction; and I hope that you will not take my good
wishes amiss, even though they come from a writer
who is not competent to appraise at its true value the
full worth of your noble efforts.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
